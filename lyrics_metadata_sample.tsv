the pause of mr. claus	this next song we're going to dedicate to a great american, organization. tonight i'd like to dedicate this to our boys in the fbi. well, wait a minute. it's hard to be an fbi man. i mean, first, of all, being an fbi man, you have to be over 40 years old. and the reason is that it takes at least 25 years with the, organization to be that much of a bastard. it's true. you just, can't join, you know. it needs an atmosphere where your, natural bastardness can grow and develop and take a, meaningful shape in today's complex society. but that's not why i want to dedicate the song to the fbi. i, mean, the job that they have to do is a drag. i mean, they have, to follow people around, you know. that's part of their job. follow me around. i'm out on the highway and i'm drivin' down the road and i, run out of gasoline. i pull over to the side of the road. they, gotta pull over too - make believe that they ran out, you know. i go to get some gasoline. they have to figure out whether, they should stick with the car or follow me. suppose i don't, come back and they're stayin' with the car. or if i fly on the airplanes, i could fly half fare because i'm 12, to 22. and they gotta pay the full fare. but the thing is that, when you pay the full fare, you have to get on the airplane, first, so that they know how many seats are left over for the, half fare kids. right? and sometimes there aren't any seats, left over, and sometimes there are, but that doesn't mean that you have to go. suppose that he gets on and fills up the last seat, so you can't, get on. then he gets off then you can get on. what's he gonna do?, well, it's a drag for him. but that's not why i want to dedicate the song to the fbi. during these hard days and hard weeks, everybody always, has it bad once in a while. you know, you have a bad time of, it, and you always have a friend who says hey man	wait a minute	-0.6674312055110931	-0.1405666768550872	-0.3263200223445892

and then there was silence	turn your head and see the fields of flames, he carries along, from a distant place, he's on his way, he'll bring decay, in shades of grey, we're doomed to face the night, light's out of sight, since we've reached the point of no return, we pray for the starlight we wait for the moon, the sky is empty, alone in the unknown, we're getting nowhere, we have been betrayed by the wind and the rain, the sacred hall's empty and cold, the sacrifice made should not be done in vain, revenge will be taken by rome, we live a lie, under the dying moon, pale-faced laughs doom, indulges in delight, it's getting out of hand, the final curtain will fall, hear my voice, there is no choice, there's no way out, you'll find out, we don't regret it, so many men have failed but now he's, go out and get it, the madman's head it shall be thine, we don't regret it, that someone else dies hidden in, go out and get it, orion's hound shines bright, don't you think it's time to stop the chase, around the ring, just stop running, running, round the ring, don't you know that fate has been decided, by the gods, feel the distance, distance, out of reach, welcome to the end, watch your step, cassandra, you may fall, as i've stumbled on the field, find myself in darkest places, find myself drifting away, and the other world, the other world appears, find myself she dies in vain, i cannot be freed, i'm falling down, as time runs faster, moves towards disaster, the ferryman will wait for you, my dear, and then there was silence, just a voice from the other world, like a leaf in an icy world, memories will fade, misty tales and poems lost, all the bliss and beauty, will be gone, will my weary soul find release for a while, at the moment of death i will smile, it's the triumph of shame and disease, in the end, raise my hands and praise the day, break the spell show me the, in decay, the flame of troy will shine bright, the newborn child will carry ruin to the hall, the newborn's death would be a blessing to us all, good choice?, bad choice?, out of three you've chosen misery, power and wisdom you deny, war is the only answer when love will conquer fear, so the

run, nowhere to hide, nothing to lose like one we'll stand, we'll face the storm, created by a man, roar roar roar roar, troy, and as the lion slaughters man, i am the wolf and you're the lamb, troy will fall round the walls, faith is shattered, bodies fall, nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, nothing to lose like one we'll stand, it's all for one and one for all, we live for will be wiped out, i feel that something's, surprise, surprise they're gone, full moon your time goes by, and new moon's still kept out of sight, we live, misty tales and poems lost, all the bliss and beauty will be gone,

forevermore, no hope, the blind leads the blind, carry on, though future's denied, mare or stallion, there's far more inside, we are in at the kill we'll cheerfully die, misty tales and poems lost, all the bliss and beauty, will be gone, my weary soul find release for a while, at the moment of death i will smile, it's the triumph of shame and disease, in the end, raise my hands and praise the day, break the spell show me the, in decay, the flame of troy will shine bright, holy light shines on, so the judgement's been made, we're condemned though the trial's far ahead, the crack of doom,
