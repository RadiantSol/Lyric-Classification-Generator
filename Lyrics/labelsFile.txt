bound in chains

got a song
seems the cars
say your prayers
got a choice

finds its way
closing the border
weaponize enemy airwaves

burning an inferno
use a fork
lettin the beat
tell another person
know your name
head up hands
find my way
disappears those boys
swallow my stomach
had enough tryna
give me butterflies
find my prince
living in wonder
see her cry
rode a dirt
feel the way

smiling the sound
gone an eternity
made of glass
makes my story
swept away hope
holding a prison
is no disguise
raging raging bull
feel alive beam
walking awake awake
open your eyes
takes all night
make my body
cause a stonell
show you baby
proven in theory
spreads like cancer
had a friend
taste the flower
cut and paste
drink the quicksand
speak in tongues
cleanse my soul
rests the flames
goes on bodies
transforms the past
sharpened teeth phrases
falling over love
read all rain
take your woman
dance for hours
ease your pain
know which way
singin the blues
tell the band
speaks in rhymes
miss your eyes
say a word
fling crazy love
change the game

marching one beat

dreams my roots
awaken ruinous fiend
tied to distance
live your life
is a mirror
rip my roots
get my hands
follow my footsteps
pulling me side
is no chance
blearing pacific winds
blinding light emanates
shattered our design
become a path
crack and flake
venture through time
flare this glow
become the practice
behold the crown
made of flesh
stray learning balance
grown of wood
let these tendril
lost in translation
glowing great repeat
see my mark
jump from dream
faced with everyones
striving for resolution
turn your back
given the means
attacking the body
sedate intellectual pacification
hailed as heroes
opened my eyes
had the courage
gave them hell
drink till victory
gives me justice
live in poverty
coming home tonight
lives and cultures
has the skill
want a band
fought for freedom
promise your children
sleep no one
follow the jaw
make an infantry
put a distance
brought for pictures
abandoned like ballots
is no connection
become a soldier
everyones a critic
hide his heaven
feels like surrender
play our song
tell me actions
fake the greatness
collect spare change
set the world
associate with vulnerability
doing key bumps
paced in agitation
point your finger
have a floor
lose the spirit
assume the position
have a pineapple
fall in love
wanted our love
is no romance
was a part
rock me mama
getcha some candy
know a color
hear the minutes
died last night
gained still things
creep and crawl
break your back
carried my heart
sings along baby
look alike look
see our future
fall one step
do the things
open the door
hurt that way
close my eyes
take my eyes
look for trouble
turning off lights
face the dealings
take the heartache
let the feelings
take the love
watching my dreams
lost until today
matters no forgiveness
pushed my sorrows
made my colours
come our day
ohh yeah mmmm
tell the truth
dreamed a dream
feel the groove
like the way
lose my attention
hurts my soul
knew you thinkin
read your mind
win my heart
fill the emptiness
lost in regrets
fall young girl
was a girl
feeling like nothings
took his anger
made you part
turn the page
get up morning
makes my appetite
kissing your lips
miss your face
got a hold
flipping their hair
spread my wings
face an army
lie the words
let our hearts
squeeze the war
say the things
got some nerve
borders my city
need some receipts
losing my mind
found a dream
get your car
waiting for hope
have a bit
hold my pillow
falling in love
licking your lips
is no ground
keep the faith
read my mind
wanted a lover
like watching cartoons
need a souvenir
juggle the way
walk through walls
pass out drink
got the sauce
wait a minute
do the hula
cause a gun
know what people
get the crown
fell in love
give me emancipation
having bad dreams
see the future
waste our time
tell no fables
question my decisions
have a problem
see a female
touch your neighbor
wrote a song
be playin stupid
see the future
build a house
ended the story
locked the doors
control the sunshine
has a crush
turn my volume
had a dream
give me love
lost my hope
sees the dangers
has thirty books
find my way
watch the sunrise
open my eyes
throw many options
got a vibe
kicking up dust
gone empty house
painted my nails
had no friends
heard your name
wanna be chaos
see our children
cooking a meal
setting new ground
feel your eyes
hold my hand
want this heart
fall asleep baby
close your eyes
had a dream
improve what kinda
eat in school
showed me love
need some time
use our bodies
shows the others
dial the telephone
open your eyes
feel that weight
open the closet
found my anchor
rest my head
go to sleep
broken hearted boyfriend
snoring rainy day
close your eyes
having my fun
gone this time
met a man
saw a car
takes this road
fuel this fire
close my eyes
cloud my mind
question my integrity
pass my time
mend each time
had the house
ease my mind
done right midnight
tell your friends
feel the tension
reach the end
get a read
thinks my days
seen the girl
followed a spark
took the time
forgot this place
planted a voice
did a television
animazing a work
fakes my posse
chosen no need
lit lit dddrinks
upgradin my pens
been that monster
wearing that mint
destroys my oompaloompas

acting hella petty
drop the bombs
want the venom
pull the stunts

punched into walls
got the thumbs
seen your father
needed a hug
burn the books
freestyle in trance
left a message
ally your partner
kept my eyes
had your butt
honored your request
knows the colour
hit the ground
make the knees
wear their faces
get home sound
rest this bygone
step one step
lead the rest
had this lack
miss your smell
feel the bones
raked over coals
worn such fear
playing the guy
see this turmoil
feel a part
make some home
breathed my wellknown
spite my face
feel like love
comes the feeling
soften my guard
offspring of truth
need a break
leave my story
worn my heart
thine own self
drive your car
understand what part
open your mind
like her back
take a number
know about destruction
shave your head
find a fella
have the house
die from restraint
averting your glances
go from sunrise
fallen down joan
wanted an object
heard a tapping
seen his eye
change my mind
take the wall
face every day
grab the money
picture a memory
are unsmiling faces
gimme one minute
fly your way
are unsmiling faces
had a premonition
goes down shadows
lose no give
fill with sleep
believe my words
watching the sun
think about dreams
know the way
is a smile
watch the world
want scarlet minds
call no knock
know the truth
make a fool
touch the sky
is a voice
tasting the saltwater
cuts the air
cuts the air
follow the call
changed this world
open your heart
is no future
change your mind
blame no words
play the game
heard a tapping
know your kind
set my heart
see us alight
faded the monsters
like my wall
say another word
want in gold
moving like gun
doubt my dedication
chasing our demons
catch my breath
cross the line
need the light
scream your name
call my friends
get out fore
need a moment

watch the earth
believe this warrior
thought of suicide
close my eyes
does his skin
go which way
see most motherfuckers
stopping me buck
losing my breathe
following my dreams
take this peace
make the pain
watch the knife
bludgeoned to death
starring the children
grab the axe
emerges and slashes
building an empire
amputate limbs delicatesse
gouging into flesh
wheeling a flatulent
numbing  depresonalisation
stalk my prey
erased automaticly blocking
rot her body
bobs bizarre bazaar
resist the call
altered the state
exhume the dead
amputated  stumps
decide their fate
detruncated unsatisfied urges
matter my excess
become no theory
spade the facts
smooth the hunt
slithering through life
contaminate  degradation
reform a psychopath
inundated with revolting
demoralized nullified insanity
move in disgust
paving his way
adore operating doors
entombed misanthropic insanity
show no remorse
awash no standards
mark the end
raising mahogany coffin
rot  recipes
feeding perversity libertine
guided by excrements
detraques de vice
crushing  purulent
have such sights
trample the vermin
failing surgical abomination
recommended necrotic nutrients
dominate exhibitionist features
nailed  attention
seethe an abomination
suffering in ecstasy
watch the mouth
nurtured by redundancy
enjoy your minute
tearing the world
enumerate no artery
feeds the ideology
face the truth
failed contagious viruses
eimai ta bradia
eimai click clack
try ozone ozone
express the words
know your man
take my breath
know your name
living in sin
see the faces
woke up today
tell the truth
play my music

pavements tired starlings
know that things
care for music
taken by surprise
guide the future
count my checks
seems like yesterday

cried while friends
watching tv talk
wasting your time

take some action
caught getting head

lies your values
sell out millions
controlled by pocket
fall the call
find your dreams
sit down line
runs a river
filled with exhilaration
describe the terror
build our bibles
seen a lot
close your eyes
make a move
have no soul
support the police
see the writing
untied big day
wish me luck
hear the mirror
see that elephant
say the word
remember the time
make a movie
took a bath
find my love
see you tonight

fell hard star
struggled in vain
telling your parents

searching for death
got the time

spent in hell
hate the ashes
poisoned fountains flashbacks
cross this river
behold the apocalypse
is no life
live in solitude
believed in sentences
eat the pain
become a part
is no light
set his mind
walk through war
glutton for punishment
facing the demons
breaking the law
was a place
running scared ashes
run your life
fight the powers
is a reason
forcefeeding me anguish
torn from home
found the time
come home tonight
searching all day
kidnap the kids
close my eyes
died that day
strangling our necks
closing in take
seen this road
pull your head
make no difference
handle another day
take your time
keeping my eyes
got my self
left with reflections
everytime my back
killing its host
found my way
feel the blood
saw the wildfire
carry the cross
watched a change
striking with impunity

everytime my boats
collect my things
got some poison
got a place
do something somethings
turned my headstone
feel this way
running away children
cried your eyeballs
burning bright pumpkin
is a hole
hold your hand
found a girl
spent two years
done a lot
wasted your mind
gain my stride
dare fret girl
saying that things
wonder a reflection
carry the things
knew the course
left downstream reflections
worship the sun
singing this song
paid the price
kiss our child
tells her mother
bought a comic
grows and remnants
seems her acid
twisted your neck
come along wind
splashes wind flaps
thought your heart
playing the gameand
is a place
left the stall
grabs a hold
touched my lovers
open my eyes
watch the singing
ruin the day
done is perfection
walk on candle
working all night
exorcised the weekend
take my shoes
makes a monkey
sounds like machines

counting the hours
got a heart
got a meet
have no faith
let gods kingdom
saw a face

paint my face
told me today
whispering your name
memorize every line
saw the light
turns and laughter
begs another question
wipe some space

sign ordinary pain
look like violence
close the door
sipping soft vowels
bother your head
select the shelf
need a place
want the things
give you space
pray for peace
let this love
see a prisoner
running the game
breaking every inch
stole my glass
got a hole
disagree from genesis
get no sleep
feeling the strain
fight for centuries
search for light
spent my life
have some love
give him prescriptions
help the dying
is no exit
says no one
love the things
play the song
minding what state
orbiting the world
had more time
finding no recognition
enjoy our vegemite
traveling in circles
put my hand
throw the key
gets a chance
played a fourstring
start my walk
put your altars
stick a pin
whoa this nigga
gifted my music
see your smile
need your love
got a hold
put your shirt
see my cries
break my heart
losing my mind
see each day
take my place
pay close attention
fall the things
told ya boi
walked these streets
work three jobs
feel this way
is a secret
dream a lot
lost between dreams
close your eyes
feel my demons
remove the leaves
had a dream
left this town
climb the trees
feels like yesterday
remember skinny dipping
walking through fire
leaving with regrets
remember a lock
shake it baby
have some fun
got the fire
takes nothing changes
lost the day
come on girl
live our lives
kill the party
met a lot
jump jump jump
rest in peace
pay no attention
rules wolf eyes
tie your shoes
put the poets
fix your pain
is no truth
hides the night
find a hand
find your way
wishing for time
tells little secrets
love the straw
float on water
held my breath
open your eyes
put my pen
split my mind
start my day
feed my demons
fell in love
talk a minute
got the eyes
smoking a cigarette
takes control dance
do the things
hold the door
love when words
took your hand
started your car
drive his car
thought to things
know what love
learned its lesson
question the stars
yearning this need
know my arms
know the feeling
said the world
is sweeter music
wonder your lips
memorize every line
hear a lark
see a movie
sing a song
see my face
teased at life
see a life
falling silently echo
light the dawn
state my case
love you night
love this time
need my love
freed a lot
ease your mind
fit those raindrops
falling in love
take my hand
weave our dreams
drink the wine
had a love
face a world
had a style
feeling that way
had a day
light the corners
need my baby
learned of love
go back crystal
see santas presents
come let earth
be thy name
close my eyes
go to bed
ease my memory
understand every time
love my friend
bring true love
hide these feelings
singing his song
laid a hand
climbed the ladder
was a man
love you child
forget my feelings
need you today
spend a holiday
line the fireplace
mean a thing
painted candy canes
have a peek
is no one
ohh my heart
break your heart
got your reasons
took your presence
take your love
held a piper
take her place
forget the way
found the love
make an idol
follow your heart
eased the pain
see the rest
is always lots
share this life
like your kind
feel that magic
play while palm
made a fool
lift your head
hung some tinsel
wear your inside
raise my head
wearing your armour
facing the ground
have no plan
lay your weight
cast our nets
know this love
share my troubles
touch a hair
thinking of escape
walk through walls
leave your side
traveling the north
bearing my name
hold your head
want your future
killed your father
become the mother
suck the suck
had a heartbeat
heard a story
fight this time
lose this moment
caught my eye
outta my mind
got a lifeline
bound for shipwreck
found a way
saw an angel
get much wronger
hit the floor
see your halo
broke my heart
shake a hand
lights sparkling snow
know that santas
doing new years
make my heart
coming out puzzle
praise thy name
follow though none
rejoice ye lights
is power power
sings my soul
hear the savior
is no shadow
take your tune
hear the clock
close my eyes
try every turn
close your eyes
find true love
found a love
make the stars
happens every time
broke my heart
get your medicine
hear a voice
go a day
tell me somethin
shed his grace
shed his grace
felt the way
ignite your bones
have a heart
make this place
come thou fount
see the stars
washing my eyes
hold my hand
find a life
look for trouble
had a dream
tell my story
feel the pain
took the midnight
let the games
have the tendency
having the time
is a lot
calls me love
become a plan
change the weather
rewrite the stars
give us faith
die no way
hear the tickin
get another chance
believe though hope
lay your heart
takes a lot
hold your breath
like free cause
set my world
find a life
made the man
hit the brakes
need a singer
start the corolla
keep a secret
spent my nights
miss my cinderella
got a birds
lost my drink
put armor armor
waiting all week
treat my love
meet cause baby
want your forgiveness
following your trail
ride this intro
think my roommates
rolling red carpets
que te mudes
do the things
feels like baby
is a cure
use a queen
send a text
aye ou aye
miss the snow
is a price
unwearing flight sweeping
got my foot
got a babys
loosing all control
unleashing the sound
tearing through flesh
ignite jet fighter
see with eyes
abandon all hope
find a reason
hold back desire
hear your mouth
seen a man
wasting your life
pollute his head
fight no one
let the genie
making the decisions
take no shit
learn the execution
hear your mouth
seen a man
turns the screws
wake up smell
spread the word
clouds your mind
open your eyes
think some people
say something speak
move into harms
feel no plight
carrying the weight
need a cup
get another hit
live my life
found your way
kill our kings
praise my name
fell a monster
tears at tears
hear the angels
rule the rulers
turn into ghosts
have some heart
wrote me notes
feel unfinished messages
watched this city
hanging fairy lights
come to life
pulled the panic
has a ring
causing the chaos
let the band
question that life
love your goal
fell in line
pretend that perfection
floods with rain
is a ghost
find my peace
feel and time
lose their meaning
go shallow love
clear my atmosphere
call the sea
locking the door
rolling my days
break your heart
know this side
had a man
got this feeling
amplify my thoughts
heard your friend
show you photos
know i shoulda
loving my life
love like fools
leave your mark
count your blessings
control my feelings
sake our hearts
bite your tongue
seen is beauty
crave a body
put my finger
got me wishin
sing all night
is a hooptie
feed the beast
build my love
cross my mind
take your pain
needed your help
feel your face
feel like summer
stand my bedroom
read your mind
flooding my mind
feel your hands
is no morning
is a devil
crying every night
likes the boys
pop my cork
hit my line
got the buzz
see these fuckboys
fall back thinkin
swerve swerve swerve
ohh these days
hear the rustling
put my song
started this shit
fuck my life
throw a party

got some demons
acting cool girl
got a drinking
lose it girl
run your mouth
want my heart
see them plottin
love the gram
go two drinks
call you baby
feeding the flames
is no sense
take the blame
took a while
inhale the future
have my time
see your minds
give your mind
give from head
have a drink
seems a whispers
finish this song
is no fun
write this song
having fivestar breakfast
hear the man
hold that love
put a bet
replace  nope
lock those doors
saying a word
place their bets
take a drink
sold my soul
point the blame
feel no one
drop your problems
rock all night
make the headlines
missing your mouth

checked the paper
keep playing girl
laughing in synergy
swallow here today
make a move
feel the weight
call my name
make my hear
passing by memories
lie the way
give me hell
took my breath
remove the darkness
relying on yours
exhausted beyond repair
passed away sadness
turned into tears
know my heart
meant the world
know my pain
take me home
restore the strength
knew your love
awakened my soul
find the comfort
open my heart
change some things
unravel my senses
rest this world
find their hope
live in slavery
is only growth
breathe without tyranny
paralyzed in thought
silenced story repression
press on triumph
face your presence
driven the price
stopped being lines
gone the emptiness
have the power
find the cure
is a sentence
knows their way
felt that life
spend alone dinner
saw our breath
forgetting the past
sell our lies
let surrender eclipse
show me fate
ruin this day
shot one bullet
biting your lip
stay the night
need a home
find a way
need a match
gives a fuck
fucking dead thanks
stay the hell
live for today
banging my head

running in place
breathe your lifes
close the curtains
claim your innocence
feel a thing

got my heart
love the way
had a tape
made of sugar
feeling my heart
change the station
take pinky strings
holding your head
lost last night
feel the wind
is a carpet

poisoning your fantasy
know the sky
lose my mind
know you baby
have the time
have a place
buy me diamonds
hace feliz si
got bad nerves
know the story
said oh baby
raise a man
mention this song
send with friends
last here years
take a trip
take your time
turned into strangers
hope the feelings
threw a rock
walking a mile
running my mouth
take this journey
raise all hell
got some change
is one thing
loved too way
going crazy opinions
bring that kind
mix a drink
hit our wall
live your life
lost a world
go the tears
dream the day
hypnotise but feelings
got an eye
give you reasons
seems your ways
leaving home today
kissed in protest
opening my soul
come on kindness
come on come
left my heart
shivering in fear
push my fears
become my foe
cast your worries
suppress this soul
slit the throat
living a dream
challenge my limits
weaving a dream
made a mistake
had a purpose
had a purpose
has in store
share your pain
comes to life
seek the truth
is no time
retains some worth
understand the power
is no dream
hated so life
become a legend
tell me babe
keep your eyes
find a way
sacrifice our hearts
had this dream
hurry up iyaya
hate the feeling
open your eyes
cross the line
open my eyes
go the road
tied a ribbon
greet the dawn
frozen no words
spread your wings
give a damn
cry but none
see a thing
put my faith
go sweet dream
gather the light
find blissful dreams
change the world
cry this life
is no reason
repeating those words
burned inside mind
cherish every laugh
aligned two worlds
using gentle words
numb this swirl
found my way
had a dream
get the car
guess the devils
wash the car
taste something half
walking some days
running under branch
watching the temperature
skipping class today
feels like passion
falling in love
crashing in tonight
get this feeling
saw your face
drop my phone
covered in roses
cope with loss
find the strength
lose my head
ending the door
searching for answers
make the light
goodnight my love
see my future
hear your song
confusing my existence
worry a shortens
shot my heart
closed your eyes
understand the values
feels like noone
tell them war
sleeping three people
rest my chest
is no use
round my soul
give me release
is no end
know what love
took the time
need your love
is a hero
leave me breathless
wondered why things
see your face
losing a friend
watch their words
blinded by tears
shaking a sheet
lock your windows
sheds a tear
buys a diamond
dared the axe
carry fading dreams
holding frozen hands
taken by surprise
live live lady
shoot another snack
left hurt skin
pray for shelter
try another pill
watch the red
drop the atom
make a move
got a job
rains red dust
left but skin
wear like chains
need a soul
call that living
made nothing changes
living from day
pay you attention
try and boy
fall in love
keep spinning wheels
is no one
change your mind
had some pride
tip your hat
kneel aristocratic lady
is no one
lost our minds
take a look
find my place
find a future
follow the rules
touched the ground
change this feeling
fill the darkness
makes no sense
stay a while
know the day
got demons man
love crazy love
get along tonight

doubts your sanctity
escape the monotony
missed the point
love the sound
have a fate
borrow some sugar
hold a grudge
got my feet
wander the halls
set my soul
knew of love
moved like honey
thinking late thoughts
swallow another cue
want the badge
lidded blue flames
hold hunger hurts
make a mistake
let the beast
take the embrace
give a shit
use my skin
made an avalanche
figure out figure
frosty the snowman
take my man
going your way
feels like tragedys
break my heart
feel the sun
know the world
made a promise
is a demon
turn the way
got no place
comes a landslide

lies through answers
pass as time
hold no weight
found rest remove
enclose the boundaries
betrayed by emotion
seen the stars
thought was love
erased your name
sacrifice my life
fall and today
coming with shrouds
imagine that wrath
end without conclusion
seen that way
pulled in face
escape the undertow
pulled both ways
blocking the entrance
refuse deep roots
is no one
waste my life
help the way
enter the world
find the words
take cloudless thoughts
wondering if disaster
share are dial
steady my hands
hurts from ankle
look for love
close my eyes

hide your faces
singing your blues
fight the walls
give a damn
brings your passion
have no chance

playing with fire
describe all people
called the fools
overflowed the world
fight the fire
close your eyes
hear the ringing
find our way
touched the rainbow
living a lie
bang the drum
pull the trigger
got my heart
reach my heart
rock the nation
lend a hand
sings the song
climb the walls
shivering light flowers
hold on restless
ruled the world
die the price
cruising at night
bound for glory
dropped a fountain
lost in love

disappear the wheels
born on judgement
caught her messin
put a spell
keep careful watch

made of stone
living a chance
feels like life
living in fear
is no honor
had a mind
refurbishing the fact
known their morning
stop the rain
concocted by geniuses
screaming her name
promote the deevolution
clog your system
see this life
clinging to life
spend your days
drown in doom
filled with disease
control the minds
ruin your lives
give your life
exhale the plague
doing for weeks
think is gimme
holding my hand
play let nature
need a map
died last night
fueling the fire
razor blade lips
loaded for love
let the record
hide the truth
see the side
burns our feelings
seen a sunset
set scream breathe
decay the rose
impress the crowd
stop its judgement
walk the lines
taste the fire
need everyones attention
put your dance
yelling  fire
kids in lust
know which direction
long for happiness
heal the bruises
sleep all day
keep your fire
open my eyes
wear my heart
silence the world
having the time
turns the back
know the ocean
betraying our nature
turns into death
close your eyes
broke my neck
call me enemy
do excitement level
waste our time
got no reason
heard from unit
fucked the chicks
make right brats
keep your head
watch the skies
see a catfight
hunch your shoulders
handle this life
is a house
passed ten years
tugs your heartstrings
know about discretion
sting the mark
come on waste
got the power
go waka time
left behind leads
draw the line
feed my rage
push the button
embrace the lie
comes the summer
call these eyes
pay the price
setting loose dogs
was a time
make a statement
is a bonesaw
pushing every limit
dogs american dogs
shut up truth
take a ride
outta my mind
cut a piece
cross every t
close my eyes
clipped your wings
broken jawbone canyon
pay a thing
bring your fanny
kill killswitch system
went to lunch

try another day
turn the tide
wrap your arms
feel something words
see no pity
go oh baby
cry each time
got the itch
feeling your head
run no car
close my eyes
lost my head
has no end
clench his fists
plays some song
utter every word

turned the radio
stole the keys
kick up dust

missed our chance
say true love
said a fool
seem radical sucking

left my home
lose my faith
pray our heart
get bizzy cause
let the sound
paints her nails
fight your way
take the wheel
loose this time
change my tone
done my time
stay a stick
built for speed
stay outta focus
sing along sing
stand with lines
hide the lies
coming into view
hit the road
hit the road
blinking the battle
know when somethings
take this body
hear your voice
count the days
make my head
dance all night
stroke my hair
lent you outsiders
need your nerve
knows your name
remember his name
go pretty baby
breaks my heart
take the box

wanna talk talk
hold that groove

destined for loneliness
help my fall
walking with ease
erase your picture
take my breath
talking real pipe

means a crowd
done terrible things
bat those eyelashes
had every chance
wear you colors
get in line
set a trap
know another lover
get my sound

take the fall
get the chance
make history tonight
leave here today
intended the sunrise
got your hair
bring your guitar
seems like yesterday
brings temporary comfort
lies a city
see a blanket
dim the headlights
was a bird
bring you sunlight
living with heartache
seen most days
caught in misery
reading the madness
have a way
wait my friend
gamboled like siblings
guide their train
bring you fantasy
saying that smoking
made a fool
rousing from dreams
ride the sky
lost in space
gave his word
dancing with tears
watching every move
right the wrong
seen my demons
gave his word
feel two hearts
see the moonshine
invoke the machine
resting my head
hear me dweller
shed over days
stand your ground
waste no time
is no need
count the days
choke their minds
loves your ego
turned to rain
got the power
find the way
take a bit
know which way
bring sunny days
looking inside soul
saw the riddle
fix my food
past the test
defend the time
have a mind
turn this thing
lasts for tonight
function without heart
have some fun
living hard living
have a smile
sees an ad
talk all night
shatter the silence
want your feelings
takin a trip
caught my eye
somethings wrong somethings
made my heart
explain the way
ringing those horseshoes
lose your mind
ride this highway
shoot the breeze
ask for love
leave this house
carrying the load
stopped the car
feels like winter
make a memory
take a drive
have a prayer
is not nothin
cursing the wheels
lights my way
excited no one
turning the day
have any reasons
drive a mile
see the light
fill the need
changed the way
begins at home
called the morning
steered my way
held the key
go to sleep
lighten my darkness
have no place
had our say
growing tired time
want my arms
going on mother
touch you girl
lied to time
had enough cause
peace the woman
gets into somethin
pass the alcohol
go another road
get that feeling
take my hand
find a light
searched the world
hear your voice
saved a wretch
need some substance
hear our cries
give you freedom
hear your voice
keep a hold
is a war
show you beauty
means every word
janies an addict
gone white lies
convinced my heart
shuts another opens
make a sound
close the door
find the way
serve and coffee
saw your face
hang your head
take my eyes
make your way
let your heart
walk on water
come let earth
knows that turkey
find a way
open the presents
hear those sleigh
doing new years
hear your voice
have a clue
live if living
unbreak this heartache
do when lightning
take a piece
search your heart
see love shine
need a friend
gave me faith
wrap my heart
promise the world
win your soul
hear the voices
know the feeling
spend our time
taking up space
watched a mother
make some sense
find your heart
love you baby

ease your mind
saw my future
get a fight
plays the game
spend some time

lost my smile
know no good
have one regret
need your life
know my heart
opened my eyes
remember like lightning

did some shrooms
left the house
put your hands
found a boy
got the message
love this pussy
found your face
see the truth
call them boys
fighting multiple voices
seem irritated baby
justify your actions
kissed next year
is no way
protect your energy
let the time

wearing the clothes
call your name
maseul bwado ajikdo
coming home home
set the target
took my guitar
stop the love
get your guitar
stop no way
cruising the beat
know her name
knows his way
gonna rock
got the wind
chasing my tail
rollin the dice
loaded with a44
said girls girls
gives a chill
howl an tear
blow you sky
rattle you bones
make a deal
change your life
do no one
watch out coz
got the firepower
see the play
be my boneshaker
punched final round
losing my patience
strolling along country
believe when shadows
found a dream
move in space
painting the town
hits the gloom
making my way
live their dreams
find some comfort
see the rat
had a mind
fills my eyes
cause a man
take my time
move on tomorrow
heard a lot
imagining the things
see the glow
live my life
see the light
flies for freedom
find a way
need a man
fly the man
fall in love
done with mirrors
say about magic
make a mistake
play the victim
aces four timeless
sing this song
hold me tonight
got the feeling
cause one day
speaking of hell
say oh baby
got a man
dreams of singing
hit the roof
is a part
know the way
break me heart
fight hard life
write a script
fall the energy
hold on stanley
travel in time
saw your face
weathered photo albums
have daytime twilight
bend the sky
know about rape
stripped your skin
sidestepped land mines
need the light
is four cruisers
saw your face
melt into spring
loves long look
love your words
burned a flame
lost to yesterday
got the kind
see the world
is a land
brought me romance
climb those stairs
married to harmony
is no place
felt this way
watching one window
live all life
is no deceivin
had more time
felt the heat
become an art
need a friend
say satin silk
go whatever game
recall the moment
ripples into habit
stick the script
fall in love
take my breath
remember my mama
fly away baby
enjoy a smile
get your kicks
melt the snow
brings this sensation
see the light
is a line
see the midnight
watch their sheep
jingling the bells
make the yuletide
born this night
watch the snow
feel a burning
feel so brand
going wrong someones
help me girl
alright that kind
fly by day
take the time
use me stuff
drops 5 degrees
dropped your rattle
sobbing 4 pm
went our pain
take your wings
throw a thunderstorm
suspended in liquid
lied my face
got a song
screaming the trains
taking your time
clean my head
replaced my humor
swallow them bit
take a look
hear my cries
understand this lie
know which way
point your ear
had little trouble
kick this addiction
kiss kiss kiss
climbed out limbless
falling like snow
got these thoughts
make my grey
is a light
swimming through appologies
meets the light
got one choice
said the clock
closes another door
have a fight
like a cup
taking a look
is no one
have a minute
keep your eyes
take a walk
felt your words
see his face
go on record
dry her eyes
hide my head
get the name
use your eyes
gone for days
made my decision
taking way tears
go my love
is this memory
bury my heart
dye my hair
go all night
take a shot
wanna waste time
love fake gucci
working the days
cut the chit
take my advice
forseen ungloryful plase
appears another grief
sweeps the land
cover the winter
prepared for war
attack at dawn
rule the world
fight and men
have no fear
cross a field
see through eyes
make your stand
protect the realm
hear your prayers
lent our axes
leads the legions
feels like spikes
bears the burden
knows no remorse
stroke the blade
discover sound fog
shake the dust
greets the warmth
got a fever
take more goin
wonder how villains
remember this night
see the sickness
made of light
had a heart
hold a banner
make a list
is some dust
set my eyes
follow me tonight
making a sound
see the lights
understand how love
feed me baby
is no forgetting
filled with emotion
goes on waits
draw the line
calculate my rhymes
laid his head
spend your time
talking lions tigers
rep the truth
retort that statement
is some people
straddling the fence
appease loved ones
had the mosh
know what city
make a king
feel this way
eat your food
buy the seam
keepin it movin
saying getting revenge
cooking up joints
asked this girl
know the football
waiting first light
chasing the road
paint your mask
made countless thoughts
rock this city
lay the world
waiting all year
swallow this time
bout your tear
move on baby
mention a rapture
see your eyes
fly bird girls
trace my soldier
take my boy
hurt my hearts
shake that dog
were the stars
dawned her face
assured your love
finding my rhythm
said my names
defiled their dreams
keep my distance
illuminate the snow
show me baby
stars her pussy
naegero ddoggag ddoggag
bloom lily maeil

made up world
spend a lifetime
took a ride
resist the gravity
thought my world
change your mind

gone my spirit
made your bed
take my dress
bring a feather
built a paradise
want no filter
cover our eyes
collecting the dust
pouring my lovelife
is no king
get some rest
hear the sound
got no soul
fall in love
own the place
get on top
want a pickle
has no end
blow your mind
see your face
heard a sound
saw the splendor
begins the hour
is a shifting
let the towns
saw their campfire
start a fight
got a feelin
played the fiddle
twists its curfew
paid your fare
hang up hold
winding highway travelers
feeling here tonight
is a river
change my mind
brings me water
got no place
make this garden
watching the news
save the world
felt this way
watch the desert
won my wife
love your daughter
struck the trail
lead the way
stop the pain
starts with love
closed this morning
streams her voice
packs his memories
tells my heart
leave the city
question my love
rule the world
left to land
need the call
remembered the way
spend some time
dying an angel
healing with time
find a way
subdued by relentlessness
had the chance
cough my feelings
build a wall
mixed with juice
hold heat bangers
put your bitch
touch the sky
pass the pass
pour the soda
done with adjustin
feel the time
peep the teeth
hitting smoke money
get the feeling
switch my car
watch the wire
is a monster
got a mouth
get this money
kids my man
see my diamonds
looking back fuck
make every note
playing the message
sing a song
dream of dreams
set in stone
wake at night
take your breath
breathe givin time
plow the land
walking to market
learning about life
needs some space
pass your house
is no one
told that boy
got no bone
love about today
love the sound
call her name
sleeping christmas eve
released after years
close your eyes
blame the rain
got that body
called your name
seen the sunrise
face her eyes
free our love
view the answer
taste the sun
leave the night
left some friends
get a start
sing this song
chase a covey
loves the thing
play oh sunlight
get my feet
come the fall
keep on truckin
waste your time
bite the dust
satisfied my time
calling your name
see this reason
singing the notes
take my hand
take their lives
tell the world
see this blood
kissed a girl
feels like silence
forget the time
stole my neighbours
let your feelings
turn the music
make my day
is no time
see the sings
find the way
remember the days
got a problem
stay good day
count the moments
shine my way
find the words
feel incredible baby
miss the pillow
wrote this song
is no way
got a hold
seen a girl
bout the games
fighting for seems
see the end
lost our minds
partys in flames
move my feet
like the girls
let go symphony
is no crime
waiting all night
goin out diggin
catch a thrill
lost a meaning
peel and blister
get up recover
face down hometown
looked all day
frozen in motion
got no room
give and secrets
think its time
leave this town
make the hero
talk and talk
had this silence
feel your way
reach the end
remembering a day
love this love
make the difference
circle winter spring
take my hand
hear your cry
call it love
purchased my pardon
placed the palaces
build dividing walls
are no words
break these chains
lost my way
is a land
changes our faith
going home people
turned the page
heal with love
hear our voice
heard a word
die with fear
forgetting your heart
see us heads
shut the fuck
tied to streams
leave eighteen years
find the beauty
dream these machines
dream one dream
open a door
is no place
leaving a mark
recreating these bodies
roams the skies
make a wish
had your eye
taste a drop
watch the sky
freeze the moment
grave a lifetime
get the thrill
spend our future
taste the dirt
hate your neighbor
waiting a lifetime
get down hail
let your lips
see the end
shaking the mountains
had a dream
soar the sky
drown your sorrows
feardo not fear
devour my soul
chanting your name
got our attention
had a dream
live our king
calling you home
rode into town
drain it hunger
hear the whistle
heard the word
go with arrowheads
built on sweat
run somebodys missin
is a place
feel a change
fight the feeling
take my spirit
happened last time
is a girl
give a shit
come and party
remember the pain
got the scene
feed my ego
chuck a cupcake
made my jaw
living the life
stay  baby
have the time
been the one
touch my body
touch the sun
falling into history
toits your time
enjoy the ride
enjoy the ride
miss the way
is other fishes
proclaim his power
shake the stars
wish spongebob squarepants
close my eyes
send your picture
hurt this way
is no one
looked around look
find a reason
share this moment
take your soul
show my love
lose our minds
punch lines lines
need is life
see one day
taking up space
get my birthday
is not nothin
say the devils
go again baby
hit the street
covered in gold
saving no ones
let your hair
let go baby
got a hold
lead the way
want your love

had some problems
understand ma ties
spots venimous plots
eat fuckin drink

wanna fuck tonight
left some kind
sat with pharoahs
say in death
see some men
hold me baby
seen the footage
did your homework
do it motherfucker
handle black leather
mixed with grape
pope free sprinkle
get a level
paid paul prosecuters
making my way
bumping new fuck
stretched plump actress
rock the bells
see some men
play that song
get the things
aroused for sex
learnin the life
get your weight
heard a kiss
chop their heads
stay set sequel
pop a tag
pop the dash
clap your hands
check my track
wanted all things
begin time waits
let the world
waited for time
use your intuition
make my way
keep my love
hand me downs
round our lives
know the places
rethink your dreams
go the incantation
blacken my heart
seen the daylight
broke the silence
womb boy freeze
get out bandwagon
got no time
let these demons
faded blue jeans
feel your arms
find my way
is no sound
pick up lines
save your words
beat the odds
spend the night
find the words
falling far tonight
had a dream
saving the dates
breaking the levy
lead to treasure
took up arms
knew the meaning
looking for crewmates
set into motion
running this inn
tell a truth
chart a course
came with cannons
had the heart
ready our weapons
hoisting the flag
know the way
keep making appointments
get a wristband
saw your fingers
close your eyes
keep these thoughts
break my will
give you blood
seen the sunshine
come a day
catch my breath
got no roooooooooooooots
hold this fire
crossed the line
hit the ground
go my honeymoon
find a place
need a break
care about whatifs
meant no harm
buried in anothers
feel these burns
shut the door
grinning from ear
believe a word
coloring my senses
spin your words
mark a place
got four wheels
coloring my senses
break your dreams
wasting my time
drop a line
left your mark
hope like hell
take a breath
lie like clockwork
frequent the lbc
made a mess
break another stranger
reach your limit
voice a generation
feels like sabotage
dreaming of kid
speak our names
lost my touch
fake the sound
got her secrets
started picking fights
do some damage
blows my mind
is a ghost
think a girl
tell the truth
treasured your ways
leave my baby
got no time
need some love
is a line
meant no harm
drew this line
hold my hand
find the fighter
saved every letter
see the sun
burned with time
fix any thing
tear my head
got a gift
lost in desire
set the dial
watch a soul
feel my feet
spreadin your wings
forget the remains
know what life
see this misery
rest in peace
moored my life
fall in green
stealing the whispers
begins this music
meet the ones
keep the faith
hear the story
bury my body
got my eyes
found a love
sleep at night
do is worry
believe my eyes
got some feelings
looked at love
mend a heart
cast your reflection
whisper your name
walk the road
stay the door
is a buffalo
made of sand
drowning in tears
sittin back sittin
hear the cattle
run river run
stand your life
act your age
begins with hope
say good morning
got the money
had one fellow
had my way
come let earth
lay the world
sent us salvation
born silent night
begun with dinner
take some time
let the loving
come the teardrops
keep this heart
fall in love
whets our appetite
share a dream
got the handle
got a destiny
try the leaves
set this prisoner
was a time
know the wings
sings my soul
was a child
found contentment children
ease your mind
take this message
live in memory
thumbed a diesel
falling in love
bless the day
singing the blues
set your soul

turn around time
hold on jerry

wipe this smile
got a pin
wide the roads

found my heart
poured my heart
missing no comment

wait an hour
hold my hand
counting the hours

guard my teflon
break the ground
attract two steps
beating double time

ate a pound
calling my name
changed your point

destroyed the government
feeling the shakes
watch their show
love that mountain
seems a florist
pass the gun
made of rock
turn your head
drank the blood
take a chance
need their blame
get the fuck
tell us stories
lose your innocence
need some help
searching for forgiveness

dreaming of phones
drop the world
got this close

is no one
burn my eyes
have the strength
feeling the pressure
listening to raindrops
taken my son
filling my life
rest in peace
ravens over battlefield
falls the maiden
shead a tear
making dying leaves
left vainolas heart
shaped of tears
pass your halls
leaving his dreams
fled this world
fight for light
frost no warmth
is some beating
had three daughters
filled with joy
see the victims
shared someone elses
see blue sea
spreads her wings
catch the rays
see and behold
takes its place
feel the earth
heard your footsteps
coming i dream
see the cracks
shed a tear
dreaded one poison
turning back drowning
supressed by life
use the power
hear my prayer
realise my punishment
unveiled by temptation
dreaming a lie
found a way
spill a tear
leave your heart
whisper your name
take my hand
bless this mess
yesterdays the past
knows no one
hate the heartsick
feels the pain
spill a tear
shine in time
do no harm
chasing the dream
find the strength
started a search
feel but electricity
coming your way
defy the limits
end the nameless
betray your trust
creating the dream
drive at night
saw you trick
close your eyes
wildfires wildfires wildfires
lost a grip
dies at break
fly the midnight
did last summer
see her tonight
mark the end
loves sweet melody
hear my heart
breaks over love
kiss your lips
take this promise
fell in love
gray the glory
take my sunshine
fell in love
helping a fellow
feeling my temperature
fancy coloring books
is no use
set your soul
feel now love
turn to wishes
lay in fields
found my heart
close my eyes
remember when life
find a way
watching my dreams
take my eyes
found a girl
enters my mind
see the deepness
follow that star
get to phoenix
gray my life
see the tree

hide my feelings
stayed in bed
call my name
falling like rain
got a lifetime
feel your words
gave my life
help my world
live if living
is no heaven

bow our heads
hear the angels
come ye o

gone with yesterday
believe a word
bow the time
questing for steel
tragedy a map
want more wenches
know its name
cross the farmyard
sailing away adventure
piracys a crime
got a hangover
turned sublime forces
set a course
is a land
took no heed
cluttering my space
programmed simple minds
made god machine
conjured up belief
scares us impropriety
emerges kindling flame
reshaping the ways
open the door
stirring and shifts
exploding into dust
feel find peace
open their eyes
seen my will
come to life
find that meaning
miss your face
hear this cry
oooooo another rebel
played the part
faded the encores
go on life
remember the years
is a light
need a reason
close your eyes
addicted to face
serve no one
deny the wounds
stoned face liar
throw your life
ease your mind
come a time
face your shadows
need a hero
is no change
take your vow
bring you clarity
remain the question
find no hope
face your fears
enlightens a world
tried up untry
count the times
written about cha
want two bars
have a mind
had no intentions
rule the world
drop two blocks
running deep running
filled with schemes
know my sorrows
love the memories
lose my cool
start a fight
feels like monsoon
hear me mother
found my way
speak body language
talk some sense
let the light
rain your love
light a fire
gone my heart
find the truth
seems the entire
stained by soot
losing any sleep
get in trouble
loves a disease
go a place
made a trick
made a trick
playing out part
hold my hand
get enough abuse
escape a contradiction
got a spell
took my breath
accept the love
mind aw baby
change my life
take the fighting
becomes bitter oblivion
relive each memory
is a part
call this love
became a king
take everything honey
made our way
take a look
got no love
caught inside collisions
find a way
broken silence defiance
count the days
seen the marks
stuttering machine iron
get the arrows
caged bird sings
know your name
comes a time
see your eyes
told me baby
got a friend
slip into unconsciousness
told one day
lie some nights
talk talk talk
got no heart
become your enemies
find a way
let your heroes
read the message
know how pain
lost my way
jaded the colors
making my plans
go the lords
wanna miss none
had a plate
deified by man
unashamed the name
uptown runnin round
nadie me puede
look my tickets
become the girl
convince the others
riding for days
got no one

arrived the deer
went to bed
say my name
follow a swallow
born oh baby

walking hey light
learned a lot
wear a coat
neeeeeeeed the bees
have another party
cooked on plates
venture my way
hope the machines
is some kind
use my mind
choke us knee
blame the goalie
wear my resistance
let the sunlight
keep my chin
find a place
feeling bad dusting
trust the people
change her mind
treat a woman

fashioned by fate
bought a crib
make my day
became your lady
watch my daddy
got a girlfriend
like the way
watching the way
know the truth
rising summer times
look down baby
put your foot
seen love move
spend the night
waste your time
close the door
make this thing
catch a thought
waiting for life
bring the bill
leave never dwell
release your will
backyards counting cracks
melting the walls
house my world
lies deserted hands
kids the music
hide this moment
test my eyes

hovering above ayreons
hear the travellers
entertain the court
enjoys the wonders
see a race
taught that war
warns the people
haunts his mind
depart this world
enter the tunnel
bridge an iridescent
behold the star
close my eyes
fear the light
release your dreams
blow the devils
live for questions
feel the pain
blinding my view
hugged the wife
sunrays silver dances

saw your face
striking my composure
gave the goods
burn the boats

feel me sinkin
share my journey
take them rocks
chronicling the sights
make my friend
gonna land
chattering no speck
drawn the line
want my advice
stirring up trouble

fulfilled as decay
chasing a love
took your guilt
lacerate my flesh
began my ascent
come to life

working its way
lament her beauty

got a hold
end in tragedy
hold your breath

mean a lot
stalk i hunt
realize that bleeding
have a beat
give a fuck
left a scar
got no control
passing through moments
say these words
forget the past
suspend our reason
have an impact
hear the battle
guided by starlight
take the collection
put the snakes
frayed the husk
alter the future
spurs contemplative mayhem
bound by phantoms
cry when bostons
come on baby
take our troubles
damn the day
give you shivers
go long way
chased the trains
lose your way
standing in line
stand a chance
got this way
thinking your eyes
change your mind
whispered my name
believe some hearts
seal the night
skips a bit
get together baby
use my voice
conquer the world
find a picture
is a rainbow

feed your curiosity
practicing my guitar
keep on droppin
watching your friends
take a look
spoke so ideas
think that things
paves a way
go causing waves
choke another second
break your back
break the mold

waiting distorted views
test the water
taking a ride
find my way
slow this places
know the situation
go both ways
mean a thing
keep my neighborhood
slip away part
let this moment
arching your back
saving face girl
hear the drums

costs other guys
is a man
know the way
do it tonight
have my trust
kill the light
unlock the secrets
break the chains
face this mess
screaming out demons
losing my mind
smiling face hiding
defending my streets
see exotic smoke
dipping hard head
throw me piece
know a lot
go whiter hash
go they guys
tell the stars
get in shit
introducing a bill
got a shop
pay a fee
spend a lot
count 3 mill
got me feelin
rollin up weed
twentyone i ball
livin at gelato
make your bitch
get big bread
played the weed
say a prayer
see true colours
grab the wheel
ridin clean smokin
bout my mom
hate the way
got the pack
live the life
get a buck
leave the game
put your rat
watch the money
lives vibes vibes
love a nigga
give a damn
see the box
met a man
get the fuck
want a dope
smoked out eyes
convinced the worlds
put your body
been the plug
voy a desayunar
grabbed the bag
seem my mind
fuck the city
keep the grass
give no fucks
smoked my head
hear my heart
got a backbeat
changed your kisses
steal your heart
doin the things
hummin a rockroll
say the joint
get the water
lost your love
have the wish
is no future
make a start
find the party
aaarrested on charges
wait all day
stole a kiss
throw a twilight
acclaim the way
let my lil
get another car
end this way
fed him breakfast
had a candy
darling my heart
think of things
dance by tchaikovsky
lost your mind
leave instead yesterday
opened a novelty
charged with traffic
caught a taxicab
go oh babe
live each week
come home tomorrow
bound in sorrow
push my pirough
got the blues
dingaling my dingaling
stood a log
fell in love
stand no foolin
got me cryin
crashed a party
roll shake rattle
bogged down tryin
blown my clouds
need you baby
go to places
reigned a king
makes my day
looking for joy
give a thought
convey his grace
told my momma
miss the skyscrapers
steal his heart
dance little schoolgirl
come on baby
rain my life
give me vision
is no meaning
rising the song
breaks the power
shown me grace
giving up control
hung the stars
calling all angels
making all things
spend my days
see his glory
satisfy my soul
won my heart
found my home
won my heart
step into freedom
do all things
praised with angels
take this life
declare his praise
do my hearts
is a sound
slain our victory
destroys the grip
comprehend the way
make whole joy
feel the fathers
alleluia all hail
leaves the ninetynine
lay my head
hold my body
begun a garden
saved a wretch
rose from days
had a boogie
remember every face
give your hand
leave this place
made a shade
spread the news
die oh moon
drive me home
bring your guns
go when things
call you sweetheart
says a storm
caught that boys
know a lot
got my eye
walk for miles
talking the poetry
leave behind river
let the boy
leave the world
made my dreams
go every road
fits no fights
coming up roses
know this town
falling bottomless love
granted a wish
break my heart
fall in love
got big socks
heard the voice
give me strength
dream ever dream
bless you child
remember my friend
give you candy
missed the scenery
have no place
shine by day
meets the stream
want the love
came in sight
touched my heart
say old mother
love a blueberry
love me baby
need you baby
leave you girl
need you girl
pray no tears
find the words
take our time
check it word
keep on whippin
outta my mind

call your heart
gone one night
saying stupid things

raining down sorrow

crowded the floor
got a house
touch the honesty
change my mind
gone the days
came to love
got the world

know a swingin
feel so spring
have you strangers
learned its lesson
touch you hair

darkens the heart
do today words
see the times
take my hand
is a reason
fires them darkness
have these moments
kiss your lips
land no reason
seen that road
appear every time
stop revolving spinning
do when lightning
goes into morning
started a story
fall in love
found his way
written in stone
talking last night
take a hike
take it fame
see a ceiling
wake up trainwreck
touch the sky
depend on persistence
refuse time flies
know what love
makes my heart
thought my heart
meet each time
saved those leftover
has the time
keeps my dreams
keep an eye
has its charms
let no one
make a brand
give your face
called heaven honey
lift there spirits
gone without warnin
makes an exit
tried for fame
come the time
looking hot tonight
need your love
had a lot
drink my pain
got a rhythm
live a while
know a place
lost my mind
hear my silent
know the root
is no cure
escape your voice
kiss your neck
feel like shit
take your place
live each day
see my love
run for cover
is no rush
breaks my heart
start the life
sit the half
is a hero
dream a fairy
live a dream
hug an olive
become a cup
smother with kisses
had no rival
slay a dragon
forget no communication
walk the streets
wasting any time
give it time
play the game
had a chance
has the time
play with fire
melt her ice
feel the sun
sitting at home
wishing her life
gone the wardrobe
leave your home
give my brain
do at parties
have a problem
have a problem
pick your poison
set my tongue
is another gun
knew a person
set the clocks
relive the shame
stay away decay
get a grip
grab the rope
find a way
let the music
take another second
destined for greatness
become the cure
save your breath
changing any time
guess being clevers
fall one day
stop the takeover
die young play
hit the breaks
bangin my head
sending this message
knows my heart
let the beat
feel my face
get that soul
dope little boy
wrote this song
shook my floor
right your souls
corny theme song
put the heat
found an apartment
turns sideways drugs
lose his way
take the trash
need the sermon
take me home
feel your thoughts
fucked up vacation
know a guy
find a way
put your lips
turn to ruins
have no trips
church the pastor
run tonight baby

attend to laughter

loving the pain
fool yourself life
hiding your face
save our souls
makes a beast
blessed much success
comfort me salvation
send the death
is no birthright
lead blind stares
read the gossip
hollowed out soul
built with concrete
has no boundaries
seem like years
neglect their thoughts
expecting this dance
put your guns
take the radio
lost some friends
happens every year
rebuild rebuild rebuild
see faces faces
think the prescription
unfold her story
closed off circle

is no use
wipe my tears
shining their toys
gone these days
played a game
have no doubt
blow your mind
missing your love
got this feeling
have fun tonight
know your history
meant the words
fall another moment
wear my heart
needed a raise
take my gift
undress my mind
painted in red
bends his breath
leave the light
quit my job
love only thing
use another cigarette
is no reason
burden your mouth
adore me baby
let the sun
holds my love
changing our minds
find the morning
breathe in breathe
turned the key
filled with people
tell the truth
got this sugary
throw your rocks
have a wife
think the things
say most days
todays a day
start with strawberry
fill the space
reappear thin air
ask a question
find a way
keep my eyes
remembering last night
poured my glass
is no point
had the choice
got the bassinet
swallows the days
watching the ships
blows any way
give me strength
climbed the mountain
handing out benefits
lead us love
flicker like film
speak every morning
count my tickets
going bald wakes
make some origami
baby my hairs
place your hand
love you honey
stands the ebony
have no word
hit down spot
watching the fire
know that sort
stained glaucous glycerine
open your eyes
dike niggas actin
bet my seedless
snowed in girl
got this chick
fuck the night
learn the meaning
need a duffle
faces off wish
do your job
know the truth
love you infinity
get your head
had a clue
change the way
remember the things
made a promise
held my hand
found your note
start clear body
lost in thoughts
know the truth
gasping for air
run the colours
pass the time
burying your father
got no escape
getting any greener
had our share
is some things
break their necks
hang on boy
hit the floor
shake your head
make some money
touch a woo
get me girls
gets my meaning
saw the way
hold on hold
rock and roll
want a bit
come on baby
open the door
missing your brother
takes a man
change your mind
sing my song

got a ticket
blows my eyes
fill my head
took a needle
get the fear

grab your backstreet
is one thing
bless your name
come down somethings
believe let faith
make a way
let my song
know the nearness

found my home
work all things
witness the rise
hardened veiled maiden
summoning the night
brooding darkness fight
witness the things
deprived of life
everchanging the skies
eve the godfearing
get a drink
going to war
know this feeling
need no advice
loving good loving
freeze these bodies
hit the smoke

was a time
fall in love

lifting the sands
change from boys
comes the sound
playing daydreaming fool
know the years
spy a girl
had a will
read the paper
see a diva
drop a line
stay but baby
had a dream
was an emptiness
need another platitude
believed my life
hold your hand
cherish each moment
know where love
believe in superstars
died from asbestos
was a child
knew my lullaby
saw the splendor
drop my fists
losing your mind
like the cold
take your time
listening some days
taste your lips
poisoned my mind
look back look
met before baby
need a friend
went to bed
got a crush
bites the dust
know the name
know last year
see the truth
forget the memories
suffocate this feeling
go my eyes
feel this shit
working with change
round the way
make that sacrifice
got my back
lies on faces
spilling more salt
awaits heave lads
tell a joke
walk dragging days
packed your things
ring out bells
feel the winds
crawled into homes
hung so slack
forget false accounts
take a look
lost his people
found that hope
built on sand
leave your work
had a party
felt the distance
feel your skin
hold my hand
find the truth
break the spell
turns from birth
seen the way
reach the stars
find a summer
cleave the soil
hold my head
find a world
find the things
wander thirteen valleys
chose the doctor
has its silver
is a man
beat the devil
find your pride
is the truth
comes a time
wearing the passing
get your photographs
believe in strangers
bound for miracle
skin the buffalo
watching the window
need a message
took the blame
need these ships
passing our way
blame another slice
have the magnetism
got a problem
nail your feet
took the smile
get a weather
living by memory
are no choices
got some nerve
rose the road
had a chill
kiss the kids
share this moment
bring our kids
lose the world

sing hollow blessings

selfexisting mighty warrior
redeemed my sight
give you praise
need your love
looked around nothings

confused my head
is a chance
want a reason
fix my diseases

go the distance
keep the tools
take some time
spinning in circles

burning plenty wheels
danced with flair
rusted out chevy
call the angel
cut a deal

following the pack
sleeps alone tonight
make an exception
find the inbetweens
felt this way
suzanne the plans
listen to kday
spittin the rhymes
fix my head
work the boss
had a skateboard
have some fun
got a gun

hold on wait
receive his finger
looking at life
let my heart
go walk walk
got a hold
taken any time

born while shepherds
is a mother
filled with strangers
heard the story
climb your enemys
saw the clouds
see the face
is no need
felt your presence
carry on carry
forget my love
know her name
keep you babe
go a day
harness your blame
is a pull
lowered seminary soul
unstacking your load
peeking piss pools
heard that story
leave a mark
wanted a bath
give some time
turn the light
found a way
need a vacation
saw that side
close my eyes
listened to beats
know which road
is a rumble
want a stud
pick a rose
hear the thunder

raised the stake

lose my shirt
got some questions
fly twilight breaks
feel the sting

go slit wrists
looking for danger

seems dirty leaves
celebrate the sadness

clad as sin
oneeyed man wanders
cursed the summer
empowers the bloodline
seen the subversion
evolving loops thrusts
fall come glass
behold the elders
bleeding the summit
moving through fields
hold the shadows
fall of man
travels the ray
fearing no one
hanging out radio
laid my grandpa

watching a timebomb
catch that train
armed with rules
was a nation
set the scene
burned the furniture
get your name
staying in love
spread the wings
keep the crowd
kicked some ass
take a picture
wasting my time
dress the way
change your mind
is no way
think my heartbreak
goes to pieces
took your love

rise in streets
got a way
left its traces
save me baby
know your words
goes my love
raised my rifle
left the homestead
howling his songs
stood in silence

filled my lungs
sink my anchor
crowd the ocean
swallowed the sickness
ruin my heart
miss my chance
share my den
feel this love
blessed with love
swallowed my pride
cause a life
bleeding six feet
see a reason
turn the page
see the day
find the words
living this life
is a hunger
fit at school
get by blood

play church bells
kicking your heart
feed your head
find my way
call me baby
found our way
see my baby

come from miles
shed his grace
carry your love

enforcing the law
wear with pride
got much hope
seen better days
saw the hell
tumbling down things
harm the town
showing up ends
know when islands
marry my lover
get my things
fixing a drink
take a trip
see the night
pissing my life
had a dream
take the mask
wasted my time
climb the cliff
hearing every word
blow the dust
blew a path
coming your way
lost my job
roll two hours
have a word
see the good
light a candle
picking up speed
get this hope
change your mind
steal my livelihood
bring some peace
want my life
called lazy boy
have a woman
had no plug
kill these niggas
represent real trap
ballin the corner
lies in slumber
find the one
state my case
dry in time
watch the evening
come on baby
have no feelings
pass through days
see your face
teased at life
gives an answer
fills my heart
see the world
scan your eyes
meet a boy
saw your face
find that day
live if living
speak of love
walk the floor
embrace without fears
clown the way
is no love
disguise the look
falls in love
take a lifetime
played the part
losing my mind
do is cry
die oh baby
have the right
go for tact
find a magic
thought our love
spread my wings
stopped opening doors
seen a man
sing a song
touches you friends
make a life
got better things
touch a man
saw the danger
lost at love
forget my feelings
hide your feelings
make a person
live this way
keep the music
filled the sky
feel each move
played the games
dry your tears
see love shine
walked a step
believe in yesterday
feel this way
do when lightning
believe that children
close my eyes
stop the action
destroyed my faith
make every bond
show me somethin
know which path
traveling a lifetime
look a mess
beware the man
leave me hangin
know your plans
made your mark
kissed your lips
find another heart
hide the tears
made my life
longed for adventure
take my eyes
fall in love
cried a river
lustre on diamonds
hear the sound
seen new faces
get a kick
ends never lovers
fall in love
had no choice
goin your way
painted heart break
taken the moon
sortis je crois
see my love
keep a welcome
wear a frown
borrow my share
lost their glow
reach our destiny
ripped his ribbon
round your head
get his head
go your way
show my bill
taken a dart
heard some people
had the money
brought the tea
is a tear
is a boy
spend some time
use a condom
slice the rockets
shines like cardboard
write a novel
close those things
tug their hair
build your dream
fashioned from annies
queue the world
belies a lie
kicks down modesty
challenges the coin
take a mathematician
see the smile
take the slide
turn when tables
loaded next day
duty a beauty
cheat the water
heard his broadway
smell your breath
seen these people
put off wafer
meant every word
feeling the cold
want oooooo honey
ridin and slippin
guiding our trail
awakening the hope
hear your voice
stirring up deepdeep
paid the price
seek my face
make his praise
be your name
placed the stars
hear my call
rescued this life
find my strength
set the captives
catch the wind
give your heart
let your faith
give you permission
makes no difference
lift our gaze
come with trumpet
love your presence
fail your promises
sing like thunder
drenched in love
climb in desperation
live this life
veiled by key
keep on tryin
jump in front
got me flowers
start some trouble
say my name
is moulah raining
lost in opinions
write a song
want the bitch
pull everything inwards
scores a card
let the strength
reap in harvest
lay the night
drown the sun
smile 400 miles
lost for years
loved every face
take my love
censored bbc war
crossed like saints
keep my life
learn in school
has a scene
ends another night
standing tall brother
makes the man
take a moment
see the years
heard a soul
rained in years
make you money
begin my fortune
see the way
take the blame
know the freedom
give us peace
is a lot
pickin up leaves
sing of pirate
hear your voice
burn winter fires
begins again hail
sent by cupid
fight no waroh
unwind four kids
walk this earth
see the sun
sway from side
driving a cadillac
do is work
felt that way
bless your name
scattered our night
called for rain
hear her starts
talking over dinner
swells with pride
meet such expectations
let the power
clouds the day
is no way
leave rough waters
give my life
is no one
offering your love
praising my savior
wearing staring noticing
is a place
see the storyteller
dam the river
carry said goodbye
come on think
pack my bags
put the d
get the boot
overlook college man
leave your name
had the ass
pick your plant
know the name
think about success
like my tachi
like that ass
beg my pardon
yelling bon voyage
tell the police
know real niggas
live that life
take them glasses
is no limit
got a tongue
getting paper bitch
know how heart
put the city
run your shit

write this song
espionage the words
see the people

standing in line
take my hand
parked my car
made this man
churchgoers marlboro light
crossed your mind
get a dui
start this night
is another guy
lives next door
feel your breath
find a girl
hide a fire
fill her eyes
like about love
wanna take care
touch and dreams
gets the house
left the walls
hold when things
round a penny
bout the time
get a break
ask for nothin
sniffed his plate
outta the bar
let the truth
know it baby
watching oh baby
daring yea daring
california your body
feel it baby
live my life
like the way
driving down sunset
outta the bar
sacrifice my love
struck with horripilation
met a woman
follow my voice
kill a sound
filled with dread
left alone tonight
forget my face
become an instrument
kill the memories
take my life
hear blank words
foresaw the end
stares a waste
comes another deception
control my life
sink your teeth
destroy my life
take my hand
forget every word
seen this face
drop your eyes
see my eyes
burn your dream
felt your grip
want your eyes
feel the pain
shut your mouth
ruin your life
burnt my soul
charging forth lifeless
believe our friendship
prepare your weapons
crashed my heart
end this life
suffering impossible lack
seek the light
fill my need
believe this world
hang your head
see another day
comes no sanctuary
is no hope
pay the price
end the circle
is no escape
is a stone
bless the unholy
fought your way
is a tale
break like glass
looking for answers
closed the picture
feed you lies
earn your trust
take some time
pray for mercy
drop the bomb
sacrificed the ones
take his toll
crossed the line
raise your fist
travel in darkness
reflecting my soul
join the fight
give me shelter
had a vision
begun a twist
see a face
tell a tale
spread your wings
held high stand
twisting the blade
lifes beauties fade
fall endless battle
light the beacons
ending dark desire

answered the damage
swallowed my pride
miss the light
is a shadow
wrote the book
playing a role

locked on baby

shaking no give
roll the top
falling like angels
scream sunday morning

close your eyes
moves her body
tell me goodbye
made no ame
met ya diamonds
put your hands
hate this love
throw your hands
vier an der
bought a kings
hope that others
have a purpose
enclosed the seeds
lost my key
believe the fables
make my living
like your connections
take take take
becoming a stick
stole my jokes
seems every time
hear her butt
got two hands
rain big buckets
cut my line
sleep the evening
brought this sleeplessness
meet the widow
came to town
come coming day
seen the way
take that child
thought my windows
coldblooded old times
hit the ground
find your husband
talking about animal
wear your blouse
lead the way
pluck a burr
cross the street
borrow your machete
washed her cut
birth the spirit
flourish the shit
hold a woman
feel the sun
asked the captain
had orange skin
laughing at things
met a woman
see the colts
know how things
needs a woman
telling the story
shake a memory
watched the water
stop your heart
harm other men
shook the branches
died a bowery
let the ants
is no love
pledge my love
watched that drip
lumbering footloose power
grows a weed
served my country
found the bees
see another one
derided for things
cutting our losses
called the ballad
writing mountain music
crawling toward adulteration
twinkling blue family
flew at night
see any fool
start no fire
made a circle
go our arms
find an eye
change the sea
chipping up rocks
watch her undress
got a role
feel the blood
left my house
remain sweet sista
see my spirit
give a damn
see the light
share the air
hear the warning
shake my soul
face another day
hold my head
lay my head
hear the blackbird
shelter my flame
break the chain
come the giver
break no pity
kill my alibi
got my eyes
keeping the fires
play the step
cheat the odds
rest my head
tell you baby
hurts me baby
light your candle
start their wishing
got my head
count my day
know my telephone
heard the dealers
is a hornets
crossed my path
smile another song
need a shower
sing you songs
left one satin
see the moment
pay some attention
play the role
hear this song
believing in time
name a price
share the ride
moans this life
know the reason
work that way
blow your top
get into gotcha
spit the words
hold my ground
go you bug
hold my heart
wiggle your toes
curse your fate
tell the congregation
come on baby
bout the book
cut the fat
feed me milk
stay six feet
hear the bells
guess the bloodstains
cry troubled man
avoid any snags
walk your word
holds the stars
let my words
go of space
hear the sunrise
keep the curtain
lost the rail
get my hands
heard the man
silk tongue gamblers
was another way
born to necessity
dream my days
forget the one
s a guarantee
kept my soul
find a home
watch you dream
find the beauty
blow his horn
need no lock
sing a song
sing a song
got the power
begin a fork
mentions the word
mince my defenses
backing frigid lies
clutch heart strings
crumbling  mountains
die this way
make a cut
move in stasis
witnessed the birthing
dripping with disease
heaping shovel fulls
remember my name
wears its wires
suffocate gorilla maim
spade in tow
walk a path
chipped tooth smile
revealed contact withers
burning thine bridge
wanna fuck swallow
crawling the walls
wane where shamblers
rest a fixation
combusting with contempt
hunt the smell
gives my heart
appalling wretched demon
bleeds mankind end
kicked a rope
stone through abuse
bear the bloodline
witnessed a darkness
suffering scientific prodding
made an example
deflorate its purity
floating absorbing omniscient
claim your throne
segmented limbs fangs
danced the sun
coveted the client
encrypted in vaults
rides lichen undead
roaming spirit world
fill the mouth
arrested by chains
claw my back
empowering thelemic sign
deny this hell
get the gun
masquerade in thrilling
oeer the land
served the vengeance
raped in hatred
flirt with fate
transcended the boundaries
covered tunnels labyrinthine
blade a truth
taker the paradox
deceased cryptic sewn
got these things
call the ghost
get the message
want my body
say the word
kill the mystique
underestimated my charm
suck your blood
left the krypt
want my love
take my hand
telegraph a kiss
is no one
knock three times
known another city
tell a lie
living a lie
wear your smell
paint your picture
leave a mark
have a need
hail the pages
kill another child
called no one
save my soul
pick your bones
got my camera
drop the ship
is a flame
come on baby
lick no paws
hope decays generations
is no fat
memorized your thoughts
put my fist
beat my head
do some soul
hold the groupies
grabbing the oscar
t3 my nigga
aiming the things
got that vision
snare drum baseline
get mo doe
save my life
playing shit savage
keep their legs

take a look
using my head
need no money
blow the speaker
lose our minds
untied no time
gone gone childhood
living your lie
threw some chords
is no way
is no safety
unwritten the rest
hide the marks
sit around couch
took the light
reveals the meaning
find my prince
crying crocodile tears
hat my tutu
see some sense
is a storm
hate those times
round my mind
close my eyes
faces going places
need anymore evidence
keep up wearin
hit the moon
is no one
bes one days
show the world
go away situations
become my heart
scream your name
take your time
go the clocks
surrounded no one
feel a part
living the dream
took a chance
said a word
give me hope
break every rule
rest at night
got a feeling
see the price
realize the gift
stand the look
take your hands
goes my baby
plays mmmdarling dance
dance every dance
count his tears
shed a tear
greets the sky
deny this heart
cause my heart
comes the night
play that song
sleep at night
have no one
mix in circles
calling monday afternoon
done the voice
holds the sky
thinking a lot
discover your redneck
lose muscle mass
keep the pace
goodnight sweet baby
brought the ball
running my mouth
takes a lot
wear their wallets
try every day
slamming yours babe
heard their poison
is a ship
stop my heart
climbed a hill
stop the world
make my peace
let your light
know me brother
put up walls
found some comfort
goin wrong punchin
hold my hand
make your days
need a break
held your hand
see your face
picking your stuff
come to town
rocking ankle frostbit
is no misdirection
press our lips
closed her eyes
break my bones
clinching my daughters
ending with goodbye
stain the pavement
had one opportunity
grab a hand
faces different places
want the moon
taking your hand
envy the power
untie my tongue
turn the lights
hold my hand
look the part
belongs to yesterday
change the world
open the door
sees her world
roll the cassette
run like hell
reflects our democracy
gets dangerous love
outlived the myth
found their way
lost a lot
cause any trouble
spoken young men
got the power
pay the price
filled with sin
goes another year
answers the phone
die in freedoms
moved this room
know my love
had tender comrade
see no way
drink a toast
catch a cold
read your mind
lose your way
read our stars
mopping up spilt
has no pride
howling the screech
kiss me goodnight
think about saturdays
give them birth
testing the air
is a girl
cross this body
sounds no chaos
know your moods
had my football
say the heart
have a letter
have my heart
sways the trees
sinking foreign boats
waste my time
sleeping sleeping sound
taking the piss
missing in action
resurrected his interest
opened the window
come from billericay
found out none
hear the breakers
taken what liberties
saw some guy
do every time
passed away goodbye
comb my hair
filled with sorrow
cry my jailcell
marry no farming
safeguard the farmers
label my prayer
looking for life
see my master
rode the trains
cross the waves
lose you fascists
living in darkness
chile your water
had the will
think that love
cross a picket
wasting my time
try a bit
read your mind
spend my time
say the musics
strung on pretension
bend your back
got a lot
make a name
put the pedal
keeps you rockin
been a traveller
take my soul
started stolen hours
work baby work
live my life
change the world
goes down shewalks
tried my hand
come for money
got a place
earn your staryou
see my friend
got my back
hide because dreams
get your master
think for hours
holding my hand
become so crystal
heard a sound
heard a spark
dance one night
broke some bones
put your hands
know the truth
know my spell
reviewing the text
got my back
scared the way
feel this way
say preacher man
blow my mind
close their eyes
give me room
chew my mouth
gather your troops
get them outta
bite your tongue
see the sun
feeds your house
get my head
leave this peace
care fractured lines
light our way
disguised by sleight
softens a winters
leave the earth
allowing your instinct
made my kill
change a time
need an anchor
feel inferiority gunna
got no values
stole our song
got some plans
have my chance
get fucked reactions
living in hell
puts my brain

drive our cars
take your dance
ride ride ride
ringing on stumble
got your letter
is no one
leaves no promises
shut your mouth
guess my faith
raise my voice
met a friend
put your hand
humming funny songs
let your love
laughing the blues
wants a joke
is a war
feel my body
is no one
seen a valley
making the rounds
speak your name
keeps on liftin
wanna be strangers
want the night
got some records
heard the river
stood a chance
have a sandwhich
become a part
had a dream
pool our resources
have an eggroll
doing new years
snowing the wind
give them victory
makes no difference
caught you tongue
touch your cheek
left the room
tell the world
takes an ocean
understands your love
rules my den
know a change
feels good feeling
like the way
fell in love
ride the wind
face the fact
doin it stone
changed her ways
ask why love
live one heart
bought that mill
die spirit dancer
move any mountain
came from backwoods
had big dreams
need is forgiveness
pass the gun
got a tattoo
kills the day
casting shadows resistance
cause the pop
sitting around thinking
make a man
kept the linen
feeling lonely feeling
stir the soul
feel your love
find our way
made of water
raise a glass
trembling 25 years
following are stories
kissed the lips
written each bloodshot
sink your teeth
walk through hell
made of stone
found our stage
swear this time
know is time
call my name
hold the key
taking the crown
healing the cripples
is no way
see the tears
lose our way
dust the life
know the bards
shows the way
decided many miles
see the tears
remember the oath
rent a room
crossed the lake
ignore their cries
sense the end
miss the point
ride my lady
is only evil
face that face
need your push
wants a plane
got a stranger
got the gun
taking no shit
know my future
have them friends
spend a lot
want my life
smoke another blunt
change the world
turn my head
had one wish
evaluate the master
say them bone
avoids the pit
hear your voice
save a hoe
whooo cmon bone
lil ghetto boy
wanna roll cause
flow flow flow
feel like hercules
hurts instant solzhenitsyn
said a word
dreaming of dreams
looking for change
talk in code
sold a video
questioned the truth
need your love
break the silence
looked at love
put my heart
are loved ones
ease your mind
follow that star
stand on mountains
close my eyes
saved a wretch
gave me advice
feeling mad pressure
know winter shoes
fall in line
taking no time
shot you man
had some lows
think that wealth
move on louis
happened to reality
sent his son
know the feeling
waiting for photos
left the hotpoints
meet my relations
rang up pantucci
reading morning papers
lose the sense
is a poker
see the lake
hear my song
dodge the draft
calling this burden
cursed in shame
found another town
talk your friend
filled with doubt
bend your name
rattatat tatta rattatatatta
explain n emotions
raise my fists
fill them bitches
play this game
play your position

caterwauling giving grief
hid in amphetamine
take in silence
made this decision
slept petit mort
lived at home
see my dad
find the forest
tell a lie
come on wiggle
ride the wave
shake your bumpa
let my hair
hear you holla
need my love

filled with rubble
robbed the cradle

roll all night
dance the hootchiekoo

rain children rain
crying heart blues
got that soul
love no help
walk that highway
got a dime
was a chill
broke the rules
ring your bell
makes no difference
cast a glow
catch a taxi
had my way
feel no pain
looking for action
let the night
know the desert
meet me tonight
make the mistake
kiss those ruby

watched the jungle
lose your girl
wears her dress
shine a light

took a beating
found my locker
lying in bed

sang her songs
unglued our epoxy
brought me flowers
believe a thing
tend the wheat
have a match
say the past
sing in tune
tie my pantyhose
lose more sleep
synthesize the sounds
dividing the citys
homesick for humanity
see that katies
leave no trail
crack a smile
serving up quality
give the globe
minding his business
come the legs
come from grapes
make a mess
see your reaction
destroyed the ring
hear a word
do the sound
renew the emptiness
navigate by stars
love the sound
close my eyes
walking your dog
stand your ground
find a way
spend the night
have a change
test my love
see the light
keep your love
pulls her leathers
gone i wanna
lose your head
heard your heart
take some time
put a call
left my heart
kill my sense
love my fantasy
sense your presence
is no one
guide my feet
staying in love
has breath praise
read the signs
feed my disease
used your face
felt a sigh
plant a seed
fell in love
stick a finger
subtracting with scandals
melt some day
seen sweet summer
had a view
fight the war
mending the rift
take my heart
make your body
forged from love
felt the need
check a cherry
lost the things
took one girl
made your eyes
hear a word
got a beach
ask their names
greyhound megabus clothes
hear the angel
close your eyes
had my back
show my face
take a fall
going to age
worn your flaws
thought the lions
wake each day
believe my ears
got a feeling
watched the planes
is no one
got my arms
free your body
fight this feeling
get broken hearts
drive my heart
see fire fire
driving my car
climbing cupids diving
forgive the angels
came my love
stay safe tonight
wait for love
see which way
get a chance
bring good bring
hung the stars
miss a word
measure the terror
presuming our innocence
pump the brakes
healed the sick
hate my sin
makes a lot
believe the lies
knows the number
think of faith
see the riches
bow my knee
say my heart
take my got
anticipate that day
pour the water
make my head
find other ways
passed the time

oer the fields
called up yonder
tarry there none
drives their sorrows
left his glory
wasted my time
knew the reason
dry my eyes
find the words
see your eyes
was a fire

had a screenshot
got the top
say the word
stitched up mouth
have your finger
need a rescue
done the door
ride my boy
aspiring grizzly novelist
get the money
see the fire
caught the bug
cut the chord
needs a bed
fighting back tears
count the days
need the car
put the ball
beware the reptilians
got a shot
pops a bucks
working the coward
cheeking our pills
cross the line
cut the cord
learned from war
touch your voice
began to part
calling the blame
see the shape
got one shot
went hiding bottles
feel your fingers
damn his lies
found my phone
take you places
repay that look
built a world
fall in love
feel this type
consuming my head
took some time
has a way
know which way
mean a thing
feel this way
unpicking a puzzle
flying in circles
is no seat
shed my skin
take my body
breaking my bones
turned your back
set alarm bells
called the bfunk
moneys no friend
knew the feeling
feel the flavour
had no meaning
hold your ground
shine like venus
got no colour
speak your name
know which way
feel your presence
is no need
take your place
got your game
see the day
got a handle
is a time
ends in silence
care my love
sell my soul
stare every time
got the right
breaks my heart
waiting in line
got this feeling
like your style
live your life
break my heart
wake this world
see your light
sip a glass
believe in dreams
got a life
falling in love
travel and travel
kiss the girl
stole the breath
want the sky
took my hand
climb a sea
changing your mind
sing a chain
cool my logic
spread your wings
meets the eye
came the angels
come and clouds
is a click
ask which way
had this failure
is no one
hear the sound
let my heart
let the songs
let your kingdom
searching for answers
wandering in sin
love the way
is a place
learn live wire
steal your heart
break free look
move as one
find a way
have a place
born one mornin
contact my daddy
know the way
know your eyes
want a life
was no place
hold on hold
chase the air
lost my cool
gone this situations
give a girl
call my baby
bout my girl
roll your moneymaker
take the chance
find a way
spend all night
bring a man
is a lot
had a partner
recognize a thing
round the world
have sex tonight
watch watch watch
rock your mic
left my love
wants my homie
appreciate our women
searching for answers
gave you houses
cry a lot
clear your dreams
see my world
rose only dreams
filled with rage
shot the streets
play the letsmakelovers
like a river
wish the world
feel the moon
met a holyman
told the truth
hides the pain
warms my body
holding on hold
boulders why mom
need are things
is a lot
killing my time
fooling no one
hold your hand
tied our hands
missed the signs
start the motor
watching your wornout
breathe the air
open my mouth
play no charade
shut your eyes
take that image
build a ladder
escape the smog
ride this wave
hurting your eyes
say another word
change your heart
took a lie
try in time
closed or eyes
say better luck
put my foot
swallow down swallow
buy this freedom
touch my skin
see never gunna
stealing the air
stretched my luck
bounce my heart
need your love
punched my buddy

filled with sorrow

need your help
drank the pain
love the look

see the change
hear your heartbeat
feel a thing
change writing songs
running in circles
know the guilt
run from sadness
have a friend
know which way
did one word
see my body
work the guy
playing these games
had a war
heard a word
blew its plans
yell for justice
fight a war
explain your reason
don your crown
hate my family
dying you assholes
spent on gods
hear urgent cries
see the fight
know that feeling
was a man
killed his wife
took time time
find the pieces
frown and groan
man those things
lost in space
look behind stop
cross the boulevard
forget our foes
set our heads
stray kaleidoscoping images
cross the ocean
seen a lot
got a place
is a girl
alluring the sound
lay the burdens
see their lives
written the timeless
call it liberation
waste another day
find and tomorrow
sing of beauty
glaze with rozy
got this feeling
is no vestige
epicine his life
hear a word
is a watch
like good dogs
appealing the acres
is a place
speak of progress
regard quixoitic reveries
recapped every day
had a yearning
paved from conception
thinks my planet
had a friend
drag my feet
hit the ceiling
incisive our disease
heard a sermon
orchestrated by boltzmann
maintain no discomfiture
right our fall
did those feet
got a lot
sing their code
kick their ass
offer me eternity
stain the clean
is a flower
maim global aareness
needs somebodies delivery
elation the duty
burn kerosene exposure
blessed by nationality
has the will
save your soul
boulders the sun
born on planet
holding a candy
think about life
told a story
take those potatoes
build a city
shocking violent smack
holds its breath
shake someones hand
create the universe
have a disease
need my connection
blowing up worlds
got a piece
leaves a mark
clinging black boxes
is a purpose
got a lot
flowing mantide migrations
detained but facts
is the image
spent my life
turning true emotion
staring into space
do our share
spouting utopian love
shout rhetoric nonsense
is a boy
shed a tear
forming the fabric
parched cracked mouths
watched the escort
heard from countries
find the truth
tickles my ear
skipping along mountains
looking for advice
share it beauty
reports alleged violations
take your place
watch out becaus
ashes our ambitions
carved a nascent
improve the hole
think that freedom
see the shadows
win the prize
mortified but today
stand my ground
whispers in time
have a say
love my computer
shines with misery
shut your eyes
let your mind
give us passage
fixing my position
draped in macrame
put some meaning
make any sense
founded on petrochemical
curse the day
trick the mind
is no point
enjoy my dreams
processing the complexity
looks like rain
dumped in nameless
face my fears
tame the beast
vain the walking
lights the fans
is a prophet
was a show
wanna be empire
rise the air
talk about abstraction
know the meaning
cracked poor candidates
fall down deprecate
hear the call
bring the dissident
change your mind
crack your knuckles
climbing the pulpit
came to men
say the name
get the tools
drink the mercury
take commanding roles
seeking a purpose
devised a set
held at bay
find your avalon
is no place
see all people
smacked back tarmac
said hey man
find true north
fill my head
crash some parties
living my life
needs a slogan
borrowed polkadot bikini
stop the way
gimme a club
understand a word
is no design
hold your head
is a list
follow outdated conventions
know a secret
comes the recognition
adore him o
give them victory
glisten and children
cowering like settlers
roam the lights
heard the news
fades the shadows
see sweet children
risked his life
forget the price
wait like minarets
deal in art
running on fumes
believe that things
brings what tomorrow
altruisms a grind
take your shit
is a place
got a pseudonym
grab a torch
takes its toll
catch a shooting
achanging the land
wanna my rim
see the world
have some food
pays the bills
saw you boy
pick your afro
catch a fourleaf
show no love
go on fantasy
flip it mix
shot hey digi
take your time
test me evil
decide which way
standing downtown downtown
reflecting the light
standing in love
crowdin my space
smile oh baby
lost your love
turn the world
beats phat beats
pumpin the trunk
got a way
respect your flow
love you baby
rock your world
rock my world
tooth for tooth
said the children

disappeared this time
take a trip
let the dogs

go outside neighbours
feasted on olives

broke another skein
drink in hand
know the day
let your mind
keep on diving
wishing your life

asked my mother
speaks in whispers
break your heart
collided the timing

is no hope
pass little signs
say honey pie
relaxing a whilelivin
take my hand

froze the river
find another man
free the people
need some sympathy
let love depart
come home mamma
got my man
play the note

falls a flower
let the suns

round the tree
appear without bells
doing new years
forget your troubles

goin your way
put our hearts
let the wind
visualize a family
known the smiles
keep the music
take a chance
needs some fixing

filled with dreams
tried anothers arms

sprinkled with dew
leaving me pain

think this cycle
makes her smile
come alive breathing

play the game
pack your bags
keep a message

feel the ice
knowing with words
mind the sky
is no sense
becomes a vapour
take my hand
see the memories

watching the day
takes a look

stoned in anger
turned the key
cry a lovers
sway my shadows
laughs the joker

introduced to sinnin
eat a bullet

cause 50 shots
started a commission
bout the crimes

wanted 100 miles
dressed in black
sink my claws
suffer in silence
break my fall
contain my heart
remember the night
call your name
feel the reins
start to stutter
do before strangers
takes a storm
forget it evangeline
see the woods
peel the onion
christening a baptism
define us sin
remember the time
destroy our head
wasting your life
get the voices
is another gun
lost aggressive youth
is a bulls
learning my worth
goes your way
puts my head
wearing the crown

kissing the moonlight
confusing these days
take your hand
meet the face
enslaved by life
arrive thou art
follow the one
write the story
fallen one proclaim
faceless one avenge
risen from hell
break the monotony
enter the pylon
bedewed with seed
follow the one
serve as crowns
ascend as empires
behold the throne
externalized purity dexterity
let my children
split my skin
release thy rage
consuming thy race
let golden thread
womb ov night
rend both heavens
suffered the fall
cursed art thou
unleashed the splendour
exalt my throne
breathes my steps
remain in splendor
cast the adversaries
art in hell
reverse davidian psalm
explored the tree

get naughty lights
steal your heart
had over seas
running around midnight
seize the way
tried the bells
built my house
steal her heart
send your heart
call your son
rise or fade
belong to winter
found the rip
left the vagabonds
combed the earth
seems in reverse
rinse my hands
miss the ways
is a landslide
found a light
owned a coat
blows the children
know my wishes
make a sound
get your things
paid your way
need your permission
fall entertaining thoughts

light the fire
is a fencer
coming from things

reading the gospel
liberated a boy
get into trouble
think the majors
take a tip
cause the word
cry at endings
feel this way
keep me company
hang your head
got a book
had a stroke
come when composure
was a sequel
take your shoes
caught a glimpse
go to mars
open the door
like this place
hide these feelings
saw your arms
rains big pockets
left my friends
turn the picture
feeding our counsel
caught the sun
leave the camp
change my name
burn my fingers
watch the cricket
picture a scene
understand the thrill
knows his lover
see the way
make another movie
passes big houses
have some toast
see the mountains
spent the summer
forget my dreams
stay lonely fay
bestowing the memory
had a dream
liked the sound
having no fun
watch my step
coming back love
made a film
are worse things
take some joy
picking up checks
dress the tracksuits
take you places
tow the line
say hey baby
took the fence
get a line
feeling blue men
have the money
feeling the lights
save your pennies
keep the band
let the summer
take her picture
round the edges
ageing new boyfriend
steal my thoughts
see her face
know some friends
turn to rain
takes the weight
turn to sand
leave your charges
is a girl
makes his move
take her confession
hear the dreams
take the pick
feel your presence
get those cornflakes
swirls in tornadoes
show her face
know this letter
inkling faint perception
brought me joy
banging their drums
joking no joke
seeing me simone
do when hope
find this grief
need some space
compare of course
survive this battle
round the town
rule the world
change ur formula
had a history
feel my legs
watching the world
made my heart
taking taking taking
make a team
pour my heart
throw the pussy
getting faded gold
got 40 soldiers
take a second
blow a quarter
heard my mother
buy my soul
put your titties
see the world
do the math
find no time
florence the machine
spend my cash
trade onehundred years
drank every day
do a handstand
told my sister
pull the pistol
know the end
tell no lie
feel no one
know my clone
live for love
making hot love
playing the town
seen your picture
swore this time
turn cold shoulder
love me dear
waste precious time
got a tuff

planned his future
yesterdays a byline
take my hand
dry every night
need someone anxiety
pay a price
break the pattern
feel the heat
survey the room
got a hold
is a fool
see no evil
is a change
lose the fight
stayed a notch
put your head
ease the pain
talk about absurdity
using sex stop
comes a time
marks the start
punch your way
feel no pain
see a house
run  run

heard the bell
prophesy our doom
produces monsters lies
acoming king tide
fleeing from war

filling your memory
facing the problems
take the fall
scratched my knees
get a grip

grown from bloodstains
make a sound
fallen in love
got the devil
feel any pain
turn these tears
crying in pain
get by get
take an eye
watch your step
watching your tv
is no one
take a breath
left a trail
lost my mind
born a brand
show no mercy
call the ranks
change your life
had a feeling
touches the sky
find their words
reached the end
lose the fight
face this world
pray for sunshine
spent a life
hear the bombs
found a way
is no escape
walk this tightrope
found a way
given enough today
got the fire
watching a timebomb
turn their back
pushed our backs
pulls her hair
glisten and children
go one minute
making a list
dressed in holiday
look a lot
green the ivy
shine by day
bring us goodness
sings a love
had no words
let your heart
stand a ghost
paint the desert
seems the thing
played the fiddle
apply as time
wander on land
spare a dime
make this appeal
lived a miner
face the music
did a thing
sit and gazin
have anothers arms
give me land
is a breeze
fly a kite
bringing happy holidays
hang your stockings
close my eyes
have not time
born this night
saw a cow
saving a dime
express happiness joy
chews the rag
say to uncle
planted a seed
love thy neighbor
smile my heart
say dear day
flies my way
go dreaming mind
have a silver
makes a fool
beckoned off hand
lay that pistol
lend a ray
watch the desert
lies a melody
packing my grip
cause my hair
sings the song
lands in town
soothes the savage
hears his back
say some people
said many times
leaping the day
lay in fields
meet dorothy lamour
echoing a song
amilking seven swans
kiss my heart
riding all day
walking the floor
tired our work
dawns a brand
miss your tender
give your lips
meets the gold
disturb my dreams
think your love
take your place
turns around round
touching every breath
talk for hours
take the cold
feel your nearness
have an ending
give a fuck
calling little tears
raise your guard
go a day
buy a ticket
stay a while
drop a dm
saw through clouds
played with fire
love da trees
let our tears
running in circles
broke your heart
see my name
found a head
tell me tomorrow
compromise my reason
climbed some mountains
running from baby
is a time
make a sound
see your ghost
feel the glow
hold the fire
rule the world
find another road
break our bones
hold on hold
brought me incense
open the door
gone but tonight
know your eyes
open the door
playing that song
draw the line
say money money
smile a while
knowing my bliss
believe in love
move this way
take your time

like the way
feeling me groove
close the door
losing my mind
lay your daddy
come one child
inhuman the mounting
cleanse this earth
feel no cold
cuts your flesh
itching for razors
assembling in masses
become as hooves
open the curtains
had my way
want the world
spend my nights
round my feet
break your hold
fall in love
get back tonight
turn the lights
sipping on wine
adjusted my perspective
committing a crime
running the wolves
know the game
stayed at home
used my strength
need a superhero
seeing a lot
get your money
take a seat
had a song
watch your brain
find a way
playin their games
singin your blues
got no place
take that midnight
change a thing
gummit money thing
stand there dreamin
got a woman

is the matter
snows a day
hold my breath
feels like rain

falls like rain
becomes your face

see the loss
tell a lie
watch the waves
is a stranger
see the end
fought the law
know a fist
thin the air
raise my hands
bring you love
keep his pain
waste my time
move your lips
want some horses
have this dream
do the summer
got a ride
burn this house
shot my drugs
distorts the sound
open your eyes
come around noon
go of things
feel my wheels
lies a garden
anchor my soul
lay to rest
had my fill
see this hole
bring another attack
found no hope
got a cardboard
walks the judge
living fighting obsessing
lose a feeling
embrace me child
fallen the hole
break you son
fired up hell
walk this world
bleed eternal illusion
deny the hole
broke the tank
disillusioned pure confusion
kill your past
become the feelings
find no dignity
got no time
shot to hell
sorrow the casualties
blessed end destruction
is no doubt
choose our paths
have some fun
take a look
take a look
going on whatevers
find a place
close your mouth
paved this road
clouds my mind
losing your mind
burnt my bridge
brought the tray
count my days
take a look
see no end
take a look
sealed our fate
see the pain
burn the sun
miss you woman
rolling six feet
twisted the end
take this love
harbor your sadness
died another goodbye
pull the trigger
bleed these words
cried the day
is a town
take your part
leave your body
found rain rain
filled with regret
become broken slave
end the sadness
fills the veins
travel the ways
say your peace
damn the flood
walk through lifes
is no return
left the past
walk through hell
shines its light
fall the stars
close your eyes
disappear a love
seek you truth
cry the day
smile zero horizons
got no worries
stay empty words
seen good people
closed your soul
tie your legs
takes small steps
shoot the paper
save my soul
turn your back
remember that day
cast a doubt
roll the dice
turn the dollar
is a lot
get in front
need some peace
takes its toll
feel a step
take the fall
cut the cord
point a gun
love the way
take the path
took the shot

get ready nothings
like you baby
raging the fire
worry my father
love for freedom
say my jealousy
sees the right
bury my name
made of lead
grown between contemplation
polka dot bones
besided your windowstill
feel your eyes
sting like poison
pocket the earth
leave wide door
show my love
see my side
returned your calls
is a passage
is a way
insecure fuzzy lines
kept my love
loves remote control
speak with intent
hurt a metaphor
made a promise
rent a place
undone the sea
wash my tears
crowned with love
feel free eyes
hide the silver
cross blue death
stay endless nights
do this shit
got the nerve
drink the night
take her life
want the drugs
consist of integrity
close your eyes

felt numb reach
believe every word
took your records
is no surprise
messed up world
remember the time
taking our time
is a lot
make my bed
feel a thing
called me baby
ignoring the band
happens every time
waiting for life
take me home
stay in bed
part the waters
afford your rocknroll
have a slice
haunts dismembered constellations
starting line engines
betray the way
leave your key
had a match
touch the hem
watching the sun
kiss your lips
lift this steaming
see the feathers
found out yesterday
crumpled up pair
have the music
draws the crowd
soak your bread
get your way
had her day
died oh darling
have a diamond
hold my hand
cause no one
had a blast
dance all night
keep on dancing
raise this cup
wasting my time
raise some hell
love me lots
see my scars
forgive you talk
stay in bed
need your medicine
done bad things
take me paths
miss feeling feelings
had a heart
feel under ununder
ask for help
surpasses the mood
have the power
open my door
eating your food
take the pressure
is a rhythm
goes my heart
help my pain
end two nights
tell your heart
eliza my sister
was no reply
is no way
kiss oh fire
like scandanavian girls
got my car
crossed my mind
catch your breath
keep spending limits
got them girls
took my heart
had no choice
toss the daylight
pop that bitch

knew my focus
miss a thing
want you baby
killed the cat
going out tonight
answered the phone

falling in love
clap your hands
use the powers
oooh this stuff

say in case
turns to winter
need more love
seen them blessings
believing for healing
kept a smile
tear your walls
push your drugs
taste the sign
calls home wonder
granted him space
tell you lies
is some things
got the time
took a chance
lost my call
saw your smile
come from humility
ran into nights
took some time
talk your mother
sail the seas
cover your bed
watching the shadows
rest a moment
mesmerized by promises
wrap my cloak
close the iris
cross the styx
meet my destiny
leave them pigs
standing outsidethe hell
lit orb siar
weep little child
guide my steps
heals nothing time
let the endless
tell a story
sold my soul
close my gaze
damned one devil
restless human gods
meet the boss
popopopoppin pussy drip
screaming my demons
forget every name
told a lie
go to war
enjoyed a day
witness a place
enter the crypts
resorting to cannibalism
break the soil
takes the place
gives eternal life
butchery my meat
deranged this savage
unfold terrible scenes
slicing the flesh
put the head
accepting my hate
repent through pain
tearing off muscles
butchering the helpless
break his legs
gives permanent damage
consumed this pit
torment all life
overpower his virulent
completes his task
crushing religious filth
soaked my hands
had a chance
shut forever body
smash his scrotum
rotted body landslide
coming a mile
suffer extreme pain
trapping tack drag
embrace the torture
filled carcasses flood
burns dark introspection
pain relentlessly torturing
stop this showing
encased in concrete
grab the handle
begins the crucifier
begins frenzied violence
made their demands
stalking his prey
gasping resuscitate starling
put your hands
spit the scriptures
walk away time
say this year
claim the death
got my heart
took her home
hits the scene
have my heart
pull the top
find a way
losing my mind
stay in love
make a fool
lost our way
holding two lives
let the days
touch the ground
feels like space
leave the lights
feel the light
und haze baller
got a confession
feels like touchdown
blinding my eyes
see my morals
live another day
see everyday shit
bring myself face
insecure and undeserving
take the blame
see your eyes
adding another obstruction
left the clock
is no way
melted in numb
see this time
overstayed your welcome
sleeping past noon
beating through skin
make an impact
escape this feeling
fighting my eyes
end my life
make your choice
take my hand
know this song
seen the light
turn your gaze
looking for trouble
get your feeling
find a place
have no knees
feel the pain
help the way
minced cancerous viscera
munched into pulp
drops bone seizure
minced with hatred
erupted thoracic savies
disseminated mortified cells
see the corpse
spew a foetus
cauterizing proud flesh
gone when expectations
want your number
mourn what choice
pocket the bed
contain my excitement
abattoir detruncation termination
towering fuming smokestacks
straining the cadaver
recycling death disco
cross the sky
holds her breath
need an answer
take a message
memorize evry line
know the way
set the course
open your eyes
tell me baby
reach the sky
communicate my feelings
find a way
fall down baby
slam the door
break a lifeline
close my eyes
make a try
turn around girl
go parking baby
let the sunshine
feeling the sounds
is a chance
rule my world
change a thing
put the chill
sleep all day
hear the music
let my freak
stick cheap glue
got my head
got the fuel
roam the streets
tell you baby
sleep at night
spin me round
put this poison
whisper dirty words
see the lightning
see the world
run outta bar
sleep at night
gone all winter
make a brand
goes another town
hits my mind
got black hair
got some imagination
wave your down
taste like strawberry
wake up lift
hit my head
makes no sense
get the riot
going in orbit
straighten your posture
feel the pressure
see your face
passed the test
folded the towel
close the door
build my towers
got my beer
flap their wings
know which page
bit your tongue
makes my baby
make your mind
leaving your house
wants a car
commissioning a symphony
building a religion
keep this traffic
is only room
hear the jets
love no one
need it girl
hear the tune
strategize this presentation
wore your pillbox
change my mind
launching loony thoughts
need another day
dound our loce
going through withdrawals
got the moonlight
done down yonder
take your god
lights my mind
filled with hate
rape natural resources
bleeds to death
is no mercy
fall into oblivion
seems a burden
hide the truth
had his chance
paved by affliction
reign the fires
colored black animals
accept your intolerance
rescing the fact
considering the consequences
offer me love
veils my sleep
burn me tonight
die human being
swallow me moment
made one step
made walls shadows
say my name
see the truth
step aside step
release your soul
created by man
trapped in time
thought my demon
dream the sun
take your god
makes no sense
killing a love
bleed our life
gave my heart
go my tears
blow this darkness
reflected cold emotions
save me today
have no energy
die for things
meet an army
fed from hatred
love for life
take my hand
took my world
see that people
seen this feeling
enjoy your life
swallow your lies
saw the sky
escape their greps
end this coma
sharing one cigarette
burn the face
pay the price
know this pain
go my heart
took my life
spread our wings
take this oath
release your poison
care what people
decide the chaos
ruled by wolves
broke this spell
travel the world
whispers  peace

lost in acid

buried underneath absolution
swear our loves

take the ribbon
stole a moment
stole a moment
lost in uncertainty
smoke your body
got a love
act name hold
sits at night
planning a trip
put your guitar
ate on terraces
conquer the world
needed separate places
loves strange ways
got his hair
have bad times
sing this song
rehearsed those words
say my boy
turned my head
born a day
realized the danger
set me movin
lived next door
think this song
goes on holiday
have no secrets
whistled whisky tunes
raise your glasses
makin any plans
likes the water
stuffed with fluff
rule the world
mops the ground
is a buzz
growing tiddelypom tiddelypom
look my way
loved you baby
found a love
need your lovin
have a change
come out tonight
takin my life
hear your lies

took our love
put my hand
felt like dyin
heard my friends
love the way
thought that dreams
put your armor
wanted the scars
see the night
look up break
wished your love
won another fool
lost a night
folded passion departs
figure out dear
take a breath
offer an appeal
said your words
breaking your heart
fashioned by fate
take my eyes
take the skyway
saw the wave
miss the heart
calm down stop
say my ship
like your lovin
deny the part
watch it rain
back my heart
said the teardrops
follow the trail
keep his courage
wear that dress
meeting you tonight
need a woman
feel fine tonight
take a look
wear your diamond
miss this night
change your mind
got no answers
show the world
flashing red warnings
sat a boy
tell you goodbye
goes the porters
keeping my hands
lies the seed
notices the dimness
talk through glass
put a fist
know the truth
hear the sound
throw your roses
renewed the bonds
is a god
do a thing
knew slow moves
know the question
set those angels
lift my head
need is love
find my way
drown they romance
had a price
cry crimson tears
lined with crystal
ending empty eyes
screaming my name
spend forever baby
say that souls
left behind symptoms
feel your stare
rocked his bones
seen tighter jeans
sing your song
comes in kicking
gave me hope
got no place
fill the room
call my head
reaches down time
love this place
leave my body
lights her cigarette
round your shoulders
sleep at night
struggle at night
have no time
making a mess
feel at home
mixing your drinks
hit the ground
think through things
lost your mind
hit the windshield
take a breathe
break the pieces
solve this mystery
see the lipstick
take your place
need a saviour
open your heart
take another one
take me home
leaves this town
tell no one
waste the sunlight
wastes this moment
find a way
find your way
hides her lies
wait for silence
suspended for chiefin
going to war
cracked my head
bout my brain
watching the garage
dos it coolin
turn the radio
giving a show
pass out music
bounce 79th bounce
wait a minute

loved her husband
paid for avondales
thundered seventy hours
knocking the window
washing her feet
shoot the people
born poor cricklewood
know no rest
find no bail
shakes the snow
shook my bed
brings all things
loved her husband
condemned his soul
put the blood
mated for life
catch some game
get their work
spread from shore
spending my time
trimming shoes vanzetti
asked the reason
climbs the mountains
addressed her pray
round me people
had a daughter
learned a chord
gathering the tools
save their souls
played a trick
think about giuseppe
limerick junction medjugorje
traveling since time
take my hand
got the sunshine
see her dad
buried our swords
fall in love
take my breath
finding the nerve
pick a lane
need these scars
come to bed
lose my sight
keep me company
hear the strings
take those shots
got this song
taste your kiss
came a light
see the lights
let the frozen
let the wind
had a chance
explain the pathway
show her heart
explain the things
have my enemies
know some streets
do the things
wait a minute
sleep all day
sank the moment
turn your back
heading separate ways
picture this dream
leave the rest
raise a family
knows what tomorrow
know but girl
make a bow
slept for days
understand the road
is no need
known your eyes
lay our heads
lost the fight
want you tonight
racing the skies
get on top
got no time
hear your voice
like my sound
drink all day
see the world
got the devil
get my act
sounds like laughter
got a prayer
tell some kind
painted steel man
is no reason
walk on water
feeling fine today
got your call
hear the shutters
hold the brushes
spent my share
lived a man
hope the wind
riding to battery
replaying every word
listening to levon
practicing flawless moves
feel the weight
go home tonight
keep a promise
got his ass
let your love
kissed the kids
bleeding our colors
stick around greenleaf
let your hair
had the choice
seen like moonstones
laugh like children
heard the voices
hold on hold
take care beware
see my ears
find your way
took your love
found some change
need a hero

shattered beams slippery
go down lets
chop your wood
heave the oceans
come along catch
did as time
claimed a castle
climbed a hill
wade in fours
hit the lights
linger a while
bring back hedgerows
said young man
need a wall
whispers gentle melodies
facing every morning
goes by everyday
remain this place
lies in ruins
left to salvage
nourish our growth
carrying the weight
let the wind
feel my animal
burnt the world
hurts yeah love
sell comics baby
expected the world
stop your heart

following the light
play with fire

use your intuition

keep my love
hand me downs
round our lives
know the places
see your eyes
told me baby
see your preparations
lie that promise
need a crystal
last a life
got a friend
slip into unconsciousness
told one day
looking for answers
deafening sound blackens
reveals an angel
choose eternal flame
consume the liar
shown the lines
abandoned your call
infested with suggestion
see the light
broken wheel smoking
pay the price
bend your ear
respond in kind
shine a light
fought a man
come into view
assigned another birth
illuminating the deception
believing your lines
kiss the ring
feed the fire
stand the test
mocks the infidels
drowns in tears
equal any man
have a throne
fly thy summers
threw a rock
overcome overcome frog
lift your hands
goes the pain
face a fight
growing every day
hear that sound
get the sparks
said that bout
kept my face
glisten and children
go one minute
oer the fields
making a list
dressed in holiday
look a lot
green the ivy
shine by day
bring us goodness
have no place
sings a love
have a nickel
sat a maid
walking the floor
tired our work
dawns a brand
miss your tender
give your lips
meets the gold
saddle old paint
escape a plea
got the muscle
got some work
catch the deluge
got a hold
have another piece
comes the drop
let your tears
wipe the salt
take the weather
hear your whispers
fills my cup
suffer for love
break the skin
live each moment
make your decision
look up fingers
take that path
cast a shadow
said the chance
moving every bone
let your mind
blow a chasm
forget the phrase
imagines the world
keep your hopes
wash his hands
tell a lot
have eyes rows
lose their leaves
walked her way
lose a thing
face the tide
going on stars
is a night
see the archers
take a trip
held my tongue
blown by wildfire
end this isolation
love this one
set the extrovert
rise and fall
say a word
singing mighty protest
check the odds
took your car
feel like hell
makes my soul
got me world
slips the landlord
separated under watergun
went to bed
got no one
got a lot
is no one
stop me baby
loving you baby
forget words words
know which one
know just fades
matter now rest
fighting the undertow
put my sweater
understand the way
say that love
take a while
is no time
bless this mess
shine over babylon
got a shack
reach the light
took the battle
swallow your tears
find someone half
make a mess
build a house
born while shepherds
knows a turkey
hear sleigh bells
got good music
falling the love
touch their hearts
is a star
sing a song
is a man
honor thy mother
change from year
like a kidin
needed anything summer
find my way
tell our story
keeps on slippin
hide the sun
spent the earth
pawn short breaths
make superior man
want more deal
dragging my heels
hurt me daddy
tastes like medicine
rest my eyes
hold my head
rush this thing
prefer the fiddle
get always lookin
break my grip
read a map
have a party
need you eyes
want that part
know a shrimp
parked my car
got a way
need a map
start this night
is another guy
goin through hell
have a drink
find a limb
save my life
let the hurdles
catch my breath
show the way
help this fear
talk about commitment
watching the lights
take the hunger
grow old reach
feel the wedge
hear the wind
flew to hell
say closed calls
got that baggage
die in hollywood
live off love
find your way
fit in cause
wait another day
find a way
wait another day
hold you tonight
know cuz everytime
kiss the sun
quit every time
go to places
need the burn
pour my heart
hit the city
leaving the words
met a girl
skip gym class
go my futures
hear these people
got this feeling
thought a lot
look back look
telling these people
see the one
walk by faith
throw your burdens
aching with words
ripping through flesh
slaughter their victims
boiling unburied corpses
control my brain
missing from hands
rot my lust
clotted scabs blood
carved up carcass
bleeding human tomb
wreathing in sludge
bitches money money
beautys only skin
living lovin lesson
looking my life
telling you baby
take the ribbons
love baby baby
had the sense
is a price
wrote a note
got a lot

took your breath

catch the bus
have a way
catch your breath
met a girl
feel a beat
bring my name
fuck you tahm
bring my name
look handsome baby
guess our lives
fly around livin
rub her feet
made a way
hit the lights
break my bones
open your mouth
mean a thing
burning more trees
make a point
play for keeps
ripping the booth
find a way
shot one chance
whip a corvette
hold up wait
leave crime scenes
do a lot
like a man
go to hell
seen a turnout
say your kiss
drop a ball
catch a buzz
bring you flowers
love you girl
take my hand
took a piece
made a deal
pour some sugar
born a rollingstone
found my indecision
pretending the world
took my time
has its price
is no way
got electric eyes
making new friends
talking back baby
seen the future
got a job
kiss me goodbye
forget your eyes
leave oh baby
beating my feet
remember the time
got me feelin
go my feelings
got a midnight
made a mistake
watch the sunrise
parked on radium
spill my guts
get your gun
cross your mind
see the scars
telling me truths
keep a smile
craving your kiss
got tired eyes
knew a boy
feel my love
see your face
go of course
wake the fuck
buck boy knuck
beat yo azz
get rowdy watch
get crunk homegirl
suck a dick

wanna fuck wit
acting like bitches

know my nigga
entered the building
love this rap
hit my minds
know your camp
juice the batteries
tell my kids
cut the soul
screwed up side
goes the way
know these colors
is a part
built my life
found out today
shed my skin
command your fleet
having robots bugs
heard the hoofrons
feel for thee
keep rolling dance
see this city
crying for yesterday
feed you accuracy
speak no people
grows cold winter
got no objection
lost my heart
taken your place
burn like fire
wear your smile
see the lights
want my joints
let those years
clutching your breath
buy you flowers
fills my glass
remembering the love
rolls in tears
paint your nails
change no one
take your hand
have no doubt
had no past
loveliness your song
fly last night
stand a ghost
loves beginning hearts
fly last night
crossed my mind
coming to terms
come here tonight
prove my love
met my darling
know her hair
take your hand
aggravate your soul
give me heaven
quit my lyin
fooling me baby
sang the sweetest
blow my blues
put my hand
hear her voice
lost all hope
know this loneliness
are no goodbyes
express this fear
lies black truth
ignore the lies
is a boy
lose the lot
rolls on rolls
dial the number
close my eyes
spins the dust
fill the gap
shot down shatter
sing this song
turn the radio
gave me strength
said my son
starstudded dream maker
staring at satellites
do no need
turn your back
shake shake shake
have a friend
everythings my fault
sinking in feel
stay your kiss
see the change
blurs your vision
waste a minute
liked my reflection
hold my arm
keep losing ground
stop the world
weasel your way
believe a tragedy
know my soul
wait a lifetime
need love baby
go in circles
spread my wings
started out friends
let your tears
got your reasons
close the distance
remains the night
kiss your face
took a second
loves a weapon
like your style
yawning ahhh commons
catch a tiger
get the punani
got the uac
pick up trick
running the train
pictured and rest
song the tape
knowing your rockports
make the name
bring that shit
got the c
find the answer
find the proof
stole my liberty
flies deadly killers
hear it tonight
crash the car
get our glory
got no place
driving my car
reflect the sun
do anything gimme
write a love
comes the rain
won the war
saw you today
took the light
meet long time
lost my money
cut my hair
said my goodbye
feel your love
like this town
unlocked the door
hear a voice
get a woman
evrythings a thing
go to work
sleepin all night
married 10 years
go to bed
show my tender
is a melancholy
swingin down home
need no bureaucrats
have a prayer
knuckling a diamond
got a body
hold your hand
heading that way
do so baby
have this fantasy
break every minute
wish this pain
want and baby
let our love
feel the pain
believe me baby
live my life
find your way
have my flaws
do is cry
feel a thing
crossed my mind
giving me chills
goes my heart
got the message
terrified of love
spread my wings
glisten and children
found my world
take a bow
found the strength
living in colour
have the strength
pack my bags
carefree a peace
wants his wife
met a woman
win the love
enjoyed the blonds
see no end
chasing your bourbon
smoking cigarettes enemies
have no time
have no one
holding me tonight
bought snakeskin boots
waiting in line
broken the hearts
touches the grass
falling into bed
popping traffic stopping
do some damage
stay at home
falling into bed
broken playing hookey
painted star angels
rehearsed those words
is a songbird
built our house
got certain things
got in trouble
got no shoes
comb my hair
see the lights
tell your troubles
heard my heart
are some people
rake the leaves
sees my face
stood ninety years
shed a tear
start on bread
tipped my hat
make a livin
missin the daughters
pulled the corn
passed my way
bring a drink
grow the lilacs
watched the cattle
shifting whispering sands
daring his hat
take alfalfa pills
loves a nut
sang the mountain
have a cup
heard of folks
see his woman
had a warrant
killin my chickens
bring you flowers
see ruby fall
made the morning
waste your time
save my love
beat the devil
got a body
got a lot
train train train
form a table
made a string
walk the line
grit my teeth
leave this town
mean and harm
see the worlds
care nhm face
let his praises
saved a wretch
prepare a place
shared a threeday
found a place
stares with envy
think the battle
moved on wheels
take a sail
loved ones blood
leave his flock
own your heart
remember one year
sing a sleighing
shoot fire crackers
see the way
shovel the snuff
share your bed
doubt in fear
slept on raindrops
like my honey
din good morning
draw my pay
tell those friends
do for heavens
looked the army
find a reason
wants my body
turn around factory
bein six years
gone to alaska
see his dreams
wish for love
got a heaven
leaving now adios
goin over home
hurt myself today
give my love
ease your mind
fly the midnight
go down suicide
walk another mile
tell that midnight
see dr death
began the message
living on gods
take another stroll
get it period
dripped in balla
putting in work
living like fairy
wanna do boy
gave a fuck
got the vodka
eat my cookie
count your digits
got two glasses
windows down speaker
give a fuck
cop a bag
got the music
is a lot
stop the fire
dream about reality
left my dream
done it theyda
wait for cause
coming these moments
leave the rest
say the ones
panes the cracks
are those move
let your judgement
facing facts question
caught my eye
color your life
opening a glimpse
hear the voice
float on streams
find a place
need a parachute
live our lives
open your heart
lost your love
hear the choir
need a friend
move round blood
had some laughs
got a lock
forget the day
guard my heart
snap back snap
set of keys
ring a microphone
get the chance
take my keys
be the spark
make the words
shake turned screws
get their point
read my heart
punch in punch
kissed gravity goodbye
love this song
took a cab
gelled up hair
head to bobs
got the call
roping the wind
bout the bottle
get your buzz
see a lot
pay my way
met a girl
walked the halls
que solo tiene
suck the life
win my love
wear no tights
see the girls
took her home
take a bite
make his way
paints the picture
had much game
give a shit
drawing little hearts
get a sneakin
have a heart
put that homefire
give their love
calls me baby
picture every vision
want my rib
loved the devil
breathe all day
hit the door
change some people
making our way
had a dog
know some times
know one things
put the top
read a lot
living one word
let the world
pave my way
turn the tv
die our circle
called the blood
waste a drop
go all night
faded little map
keeps my heart
watch the morning
hit rock bottom
fight keep rows
take this heartbreak
is ball caps
talk some nights
say the sea
hate my hair
setting the world
wrecking balls downtown
change his orientation
is a trail
take a turn
climb the ladder
living alone hangin
hits the shell
come on boys
litter the floor
bout the ways
save this house
hate every mile
hold ya time
part the lips
loving you baby
shooting down yah
fill your cup
tell the truth
make you eggs
left my lipstick
is always tomorrow
give me wings
want a fantasy
soften the lows
let the night
reopen your heart
bang the gong
want red cups
hear me roar
start a war
turn my ears
hit the gas
aching complicating conversation
feel that rain
mind cause luck
seen this brother
feeling the way
had my way
crossing the walk
wishing my steps
lose my backbone
need the questions
take the road
need my boyfriend
love you girl
live my life
need a man
make this movie
break the wheel
wanted us eye
losing my flow
hear the truth
click a heart
need your money
got a hold
do the blinds
rules rules rules
kiss your lips
make it home
hang out tonight
fall outta touch
know which way
feel that warmth
feel the pain
started losing light
makes no sense
see your face
opened my eyes
drives your hand
put your hands
got a price
is one way
met this way
got this feeling
left my head
heard the sound
hit the bottom
use your head
searching for cover
seem my body
spent my life
ran my hands
come in come

held each others
feel my desire
is a thing
telling me everythings

seen this door
celling the rhymes
got the hammer
like poppin tabs
call my friends
wanna be baby
stop the truck
wear my sunglasses
read the sign
burn a lamp
sounds this parting
faces to arms
laying union tides
pace these steps
got this look
burned limless victims
presented as fact
frightened by decisions
wave their anthem
living a life
shared some conversation
give me reason
forgive the words
confess this blood
working all day
had a love
watch the sun
sway the sky
feeling sentimental times
drained my soul
titled the wine
think about love
passing by worlds
scattered blue skies
make some time
diggin out snow
forget it girls
wants the fairytale
blow your mind
believe my eyes

hid the blood
unfold the treatment
volunteered each man
went to bed
knock poverty poverty
meet my love
is a library
leave my room
come soon clouds
meet your eye
left my home
told our stories
sleeping late hate
strap these words
give us names
singing the devils
decree the music
said one day
closed no way
taken my dreams
finds no peace
lost new beginner
close your eyes
make my heart
need is fantasy
go into space
kissing with tears
came to party
peel my skin

fell in love
take my hands
hold your hand
satisfy me ababy
dance the blues
made the ivy
call you cradle
get together tonight
are three steps
had the looks
went down town
have no love
hang on hang
felt the wind
make the thing
got her reasons
have no regrets
say of course
unpack your things
dying of thirst
desire it burns
say much actions
see your face
lost my share
woke up today
is a world
close my eyes
conquer the world

hear your reason
go go byker
bought my ticket
entered my room
wandered into town
saw the sea
gone the handle
skips a beat
sold his soul
see everybodys sayin
celebrate the robbing
met a man
run this land
find the strength
drive my car
catch every whisper
change your mind
handle plastic passion
spoil your face

see the curve
help old man
toss a rock
asking for forgiveness
see the world
got my head

bless his name
blow the trumpet
bless your name

unwrapped the world
endures it clings
changed the locks
has a smile
make your way
see our lives
gain but distance
traded again moments
is no use
did the one
take your pain
languish in pain
clotting uteral mucus
corroding after years
scalding your sinews
gnawing throbbing anguish
decaying cystic pemphigus
crepitating neoplasm erupts
twisted severe mutilation
pores hardened carbuncles
saponified fats lather
ripped viscous juices
wartencrusted sebaceous growths
dance all night
lose all control
crying a river
seeing nobody body
broke my heart
wait my turn
filled my heart
fall in love
read the warning
take the time
going crazy racing
going crazy racing
fall in love
is no tears
let the pieces
getting your way
lost in conversation
come home home
feel this way
take that blame
cope with rejection
call me rap
keep your head

take my life
hide your heart
lose your pride
talk talk talk
open your eyes
hold my hand
meet its end

feel your heart
choose the chains
light the stars
shake the ground
close your eyes
kissed my hands
let your spirit
took her hand
escapes sour tongues
have a clue
left my hat
took my heart
stay in chains
mistake a clock
is no light
sparkling sparkling water
let the lesson
go this clementine
seen the kind
seek in vain
calling that lady
stereo a stereo
closing their eyes
shame my family
clip the locks
skip the charades
sold the house
moving wet cement
locked my keys
find my head
pretend this planes
like april wonder
know whose side
think about eyes
hold that man
exhausted by romance
miss the nights
count the times
hit the dirt
feel a thing
find the words
rewrite my name
decides what tomorrow
were magazine racks
hold my home
face your enemy
wake levitate ideas
hear my baby
stop and rewind
exposed easy target
find a way
lower the stakes
protecting my skin
act the fool
touching the ground
see my face
laying low camouflage
takes a moment
is a war
happens every time
fall in love
need you part
lend a hand
express the things
held the book
woke this morning
waiting in line
putting the pieces
nows the time
need a reason
read each word
wear my hat
call my name
sleep at night
take my hand
hold your hand
cross the river
finds a way
gather round people
is no doubt
make the sun
testify my love
started on politicians
standing by round
rolling father time
love this heart
losing all control
bumping california love
cross a nigga
give me doctor
come down ramblin
give your lady
makes a bee
fill the air
lose my basin
go your way
forget the glamour
made my life
had a brain
pay no attention
made of clay
cried a river
becomes a smirk
dry your eye
step aside partner
speed my love
believe the gypsy
popping my springs
tie a ribbon
meet some day
feel your words
came a junco
give me land
like goodbyes tears
guess the longing
gave me nose
lay a prince
ring the bells
lose this story
try no one
trust no one
left my head
seen the sun
wasted words millions
burning in lies
watching the blood
scoured the earth
constrain your results
restore this planets
becomes primary language
enlightened the population
work synthetic cortisol
made perfect dreams
lead to derealization
melding into surroundings
restore our vision
destroy the rift
rise in groves
occupying every piece
echoing out existence
wrote and life
round my neck
lone the sound
left my mothers
stretched fallen rain
found a lead
leave time uncovers
is a light
trust the ways
receive your signal
left of mine
leaves my heart
wait on words
light the light
scrubbing the plates
count your friends
know that nothings
make the day
acalling lonely voices
left your bottle

walking on glass
smell the grass
know my alley
finished quickly fades
hear the gravel
anoints the earth
pass on endings
change your mind
come this way
trace this conversation
wind rush reed
pierce my soul
fires the sun
vagabondage la danse
pervades the night
go of hope
built these places
keeping my love
praise the razor
cry chase man
see the skyline
makes a square
got a hunger
play the ace
fill a word
rutted winding streets
filled with spirits
working the land
hosing down trucks
hear the sleepers
lay your money
had shark teeth
gone from mystery
scratch their heads
hear the night
sold me cigarettes
pacing the cage
see my tears
dyeing black skin
have no idea
raise its hands
lit golden radiance
take these things
driving away angel
stay redwinged blackbird
lost is everyones
go torrent tumbles
feel the fire
make twelve gates
chewing on lifes
know my place
is a stranger
got 29 ways
carved their initials
comes to love
feel the distance
worked seven days
feels like nighttime
pull the shade
smell the jasmine
kills you baby
have your answers
wait another day
run the place
sees the snow
skip a generation
see the sunshine
see you tomorrow
see the light
cried the tears
got the feeling
get your tambourines
see your face
hit the ground
find the meaning
starts a howling
help me baby
climbing on rainbows
gimme a ticket
get your plane
stimulate some action
drops a penny
tell your story
gave my love
saved a wretch
chased across sand
saw an angel
regret a memorial
stone sayin blow
sevens oh baby
turn my back
live in poverty
go the way
needs the ghost
knew my heart
chosen one sun
meets the sea
let your heart
claim my words
see the libertines
hear those bells
reached this destination
broke his heart
spoilt the view
run his legs
re twelve gates
have for mine
marry a gunner
d my weaver
ridin into town
ringing his bell
drinks the spring
come you masters
went to war
made the mine
rottning the oranges
feel like someones
made of sand
listen to freedom
growing oh father
led our ponies
rambling one day
killed poor hattie
bring you joy
got a blood
namin the sorrow
growing with people
shipped on board
hear his heart
covering the crossroads
makes the years
trembling with death
shirking his part
bloom and closets
weave the bravery
heard woodys songs
flee the mountains
flies golden sails
spread your wings
find our way
saved a wretch
ease your mind
see the moon
keep a place
brings me ecstasy
threw the bums
stands your orphan
lowing the baby
come let earth
hear my heart
married virgin mary
shone the moon
made their way
stopped opening doors
gather round people
lay for love
looked at love
love the ground
saw the love
sprung in completeness
take me home
learn from tragedy
getting away today
directing the traffic
knows your names
laid my mandoline
make mistakes fathers
wearing twenty pounds
made moan earth
have no place
say goodbye love
bathe in moonfall
roam central park
bent with fear
have a vision
see the saints
take my hand
shakes the mountains
hear my heart
dreaming sweet dreams
bear in mind
known as romance
know the score
got a union
seen the stars
turn in eternitys
hear the pain
felt this way
come on home
say little girl
bless my soul
realize my dream
move mr man
calls it fun
knew one thing
said that girl
grace the lie
take a picture
breathing my cloud
shed my soul
kill thy master
see the pain
cut the cables
blessed this day
let this heart
sing a song
rise from ruin
stretch for miles
leave the lights
fell in love
tasted their failure
keep these pasts
drowned in jet
claim this hate
closes her doors
let their sadness
become the pigs
stop this suicide
fading loyalties effigies
find a way
shake these beasts
elses old misgivings
let our love
embracing you death
waning spark fade
have their place
bearing down eye
rotting the root
shakes the teeth
find a way
come when protectors
warm the bones
cloaks the sky
bury the gun
afterglow a darkness
is feral animals
is no place
need a hell
grips the spine
searched my soul
shine a light
say the time
let the sun
is a reason
watch the world
fall and ground
take the world
cause time marches
put on display
make our escape
cut our feet
got my heart
go on look
let this love
lifes a count
praying for light
see your face
leaves our heart
soaked in gasoline
find our way
believe in movie
pay the price
got my eyes
touch the ground
gimme the heartbreak
got that love
take me home
running in circles
scream my name
made a mess
sleeved shitkicking animals
hold their hands
remember the time
keep an eye
cause my lips
feel the load
stand back turn
stay on guard
showed such promise
find my way
looking at things
tell but time
filled with doubt
take her home
have the strength
close my eyes
fear your mistakes
close your eyes
keep my mouth
take your abuse
knows the truth
had a filter
give you time
tell no body
feel the strain
understand the things
bout your body
have the things
made a fool
are some things
find another heart
putting the time
ground the stamping
blushing bright red
know a place
know what love
punch the clock
close your eyes
picture a hotel
take a powder
makes good shoes
startled this embrace
die of laughter
ruins watching time
died my dreams
push a button
gave me notice
do a thing
hide other times
rubbing their hands
play at make
wears a wax
hate these striplights
aplaying the piano
tell you things
know a girl
assume their identity
drops a name
melting the tables
hate her name
is a void
call it laughter
saw a girl
kiss the air
taking my life
send any money
is a veil
apologize every time
want your fortune
find a chill
view oh mother
is a wager
everyones a prisoner
reverse the bruiser
know what hope
said the word
draining the joy
rocking horse road
need constant maintenance
speak your mind
consults the watch
strange your knees
dance the jig
remove this doubt
makes the world
leave my kitten
knows the meaning
bringing on disguise
change my life
victor her prudence
waiting for passion
have the love
confessing the way
got shallow graves
recapture his anger
cut a hole
saw the light
seems a surprise
is no one
were always tears
keep the flowers
go to sleep
catch your eye
painted from memory
punish any girl
hear silver trumpets
cry if dust
makes the world
understood each time
held an image
knows this passion
send to battle
gather round boys
travel pretty girls
slipped from liverpool
distorted my suspicions
have the gaze
come away death
torn approaching dawn
throw the jockeys
plays funny tricks
run a motor
remember that dance
sparks long sky
heard our refrain
got twisted motives
knows this passion
needs the sun
throw my toys
fall in love
is a world
takes her clothes
hating the season
feel such sorrow
walking down times
is no charity
proffer puckered lips
sweated their duds
stiffled voice tender
heard a word
love no fear
purchased by love
anticipate the moment
believe in miracles
do the things
believe the promise
want the things
torch your house
wait in pain
find my way
leave a letter
feel this way
hear your voice
leave me lyin
call my home
lost my meaning
spins from gods
open my eyes
feed the lie
planning my release
found a way
worship you today
fill this temple
bring the sacrifices
lift your voice
declare your glory
got a victory
reigns every wheereee
made of mirrors
explore the world
know my choices
sell your soul
take my hand
dig my grave
need your help
needed the question
take the fall
wage a war
place the blame
shake this vice
write these words
sound the alarms
frozen in time
catch fire timings
leaving every map
fall from grace
call it reality
waste your time
disrupt the sequ3nce
save your soul
see a marching
turn your back
gives you lemons
need a ticket
saltende beautiful life
boli majdaheul ddae
fall in love
hold and today
taken many falls
fall in love
give my love
go some place
like her style
shine the light
leave the dream
miss your face
winning in life
see this boys
need the distraction
know white boys
give me time

makes his cry
come on girl
going pickin flowers
bring back memories
reading her paper
realize but somethings
got these pictures
find a reason
watching the shadows
die cry baby
lost his grip
play with fire
change my mind
catch a glimpse
take a look
waste my life
feel broken boy
play this part
is no one
held the world
taking my time
stay down stick
seems like yesterday
lose my mind
got no problem
see the mail
take the time
push through push
smiling but baby
put the fear
got the time
blow my house
come on baby
get a job
let the sun
hide their shadow
taught the gift
caught a piper
take my wife
gain my ground
go master master
breaks my heart
broke the window
buy your veterans
think big man
take our love
go the women
move your ass
met a boy
have some joy
come together friends
learning that life
cut same blood
do skeleton man
goes away giants
free my mind
knew your needs
ended my life
make a roadway
quarantine this feeling
chase their shadows
view silly humans
raise your family
board the windows
tell the truth
kooked by caffeine
go slow shot
hang on parade
damning my transmission
is a place
got a brain
done five minute
have a horn
like puglets baby
had a clue
gets what violet
make us part
know by name
say a song
grip the microphone
give a fuck
sing the book
leave the past
find my way
got the time
aye cdot man
hit the floor
enter the draft
put my bitch
want your love
heard your name
is a fire
cut the rope
keep your world
move me baby
hurts like hell
daaaaaaaamn that boy
take a trip
have alien kids
went down schools
went to bed
like the night
born without teeth
remember my name
lost in love
waiting no need
got no distance
denynynyny that beast
making bad decisions
say your words
feel because baby
dread that feeling
falling in love
love your hair
talk some noise
hurt my heart
have my gun
running the show
falling a part
like the way
turn into love
fall in love
understand your options
was a time
fall fall fall
left its seeds
watch the nightfall
say the world
close my eyes
hear a voice
move a mountain
blue the taste
hide little boy
drop a dime
needed a laugh
lost in time
fall in love
tear the petals
make a deal
hear your voice
watch the moon
lost in time
forget my role
cut your life
tell those girls
close your eyes
raise our traffic
remember her name
turns into serpents
rattle the rust
roaring engines jewels
eluding the science
turned up backstage
sway green shadows
boarding a train
spend my life
done my lessons
has a closet
understands the need
singing a hymn
make it tonight
sing with angels
find the arms
paint a picture
turn to night
lift your head
becomes a disease
join with heaven
come to earth
say great plans
open our eyes
broken and scales
fill the skies
made a way
opens the door
appears my reflection
make a country
fall in love
save myself ahahh
feel the stretch
call me fuck
pull my world
come black hole
said the night
make every step
let your heart
see the strength
known a stranger
steal my heart
seen the warning
act this way
standing on ceiling
picture one day
fill the hole
take the words
take the boulevard
take my hand
do yeah love
hold on hold
tracing your lines
break my guard
holding my hand
bugged wild fire
read the message
answer me judges
sees her secrets
s at stake
keep that fortune
find the words
is no reflection
need no bed
run the rain
party oh way
conjure the wind
undone some sort
threw your letter
borrowed only thing
bide my time
break the spell
change the way
live my life
taste the tears
steal this heart
keep the jealousy
do great things
crossing the line
ignore the spirit
feed ravaging ravenlust
sense the beauty
bar our paths
let precious chaos
surrounds the room
trance my eyes
thrust in eve
flies the garden
rend our blades
carving towards misdeed
take my hand
desecrate my soul
return to woodland
hides a secret
forgive the days
wrecking her heart
is a couple
doing here tonight
crushing bottles silver
matter which one
rode a bluebird
got a fever
floor my loneliness
face another day
take a drag
move your beat
come on dance
begin to rock
fast one tear
gone for momma
have the stars
take the wheel
sneaking a smoke
turned some bridges
shoot a combo
starts with goodbye
got a heart
wash the sins
cry byebye byebye
hear those echoes
told me sugar
cries her baby
locked out middle
say our prayers
join the triumph
take this song
sings my soul
know which path
left the proof
pop pop pop
breathe a while
got a crush
hold your hands
swinging your fist
get in trouble
brokenhearted days race
lose my touch
find the sweetness
make your peace
get your life
burning the ground
wait down underwater
broken in space
playing all day
hung like dreadlocks
missed your ride
remember that everythings
love the world
throw me bones
spaced out yesterday
say that spiders
wrap the cord
lose my mind
open my eyes
get a load
stay in bed
like the sound
blowing up balloons
have a place
spoke a word
move my hands
triggers some kind
raise the population
scream a symphony
said always misunderstood
is no path
stops and noones
got a brain
need is style
fall in love
hold on cause
feel it mannequins
wants a view
get a bubble
told my self
neath the stars
thought that love
read a book
tell the man
inhibited insecure type
writes his songs
deal in sex
is doubt faith
had me boy
danced all night
feels no pain
hear your voice
longed for adventure
pouring my lovelife
leaving my mark
says that love
remember the way
live my life
go and baby
have em hangin
love me tomorrow
breaks your heart
got your reasons
put my heart

trapped under ice

saving every dime

ashed the cigarette

blinded by dreams

did the beat
speak your name
brought the sun
wait a moment

caught my eye
lay here prayin
spend my nights
name the years
played the fool
know the smoke
is a woman
had small town
got no money

got a whiskey
sinking like stones
lost your trust
fly this thing
going after money
done but life
give me love
lost crossed lines
give me style
running in circles
shoot an apple
show daylight oooh
write a song
looking for life
know which way
see the world
save the night
lost every river
making our escape
making our escape
touch the ground
see your future
run away daddy
advertise a revolution
fights corrugate cathedrals
cry cry cry
had my back
write a champion
falls everybody dreams
choose my friends
get no sleep
wears a hat
said your eyes
open your mouth
hear me breathing
count the times
took my hand
smoking my cigarettes
love your lipstick
traded holy water
stop the way
hate me baby
recognize her perfume
has no meaning
found another girl
tell your sister
know the world
lost my girl
guides the sailors
use your pen
want you boy
gave er whisky
open your eyes
have a script
help your self
bare her soul
called an intermission
weighed the risk
love no use
have her home
propose an exit
create a beast
fall in love
dry your eyes
looking for trouble
digging that bebop
made a fool
is no way
hold me darling
gone your jacket
keep both feet
ride sixteen coaches
own my night
saved my life
understand the wind
mangle your feet
share the silence
got this notion
drown your fire
cut the strings
read a note
regret one moment
had a storybook
come your way
tell them boys
was an emptiness
is a girl
disappeared a time
found a note
stayed in bed
fall in love
shining the grass
sings a love
lay the world
called the game
take your picture
love someone dogs
have a dream
say your prayers
nod and dream
pray this love
gave up way
last a moment
watching the memories
call her bluff
doin well josephine
give you reasons
let your love
worn out honkeytonks
look away dixieland
is a place
guide my hand
got my wheat
blew three holes
feed my existence
hear the rattlin
say little dogies
saw this plainsman
gone the trains
takin his time
ridin my thumb
had their ponies
left old lampasas
had your way
falling the love
gray the raindrops
is a tree
make your crown
be thy name
bring a sigh
sleep last night
said my daughter
sends me roses
fall in love
playing the fool
take the rest
breaking my heart
remembering the shadow
comb your hair
fall in love
share the moonlight
see the sheperd
called our song
knew one time
keep that promise
gone but darling
count the hours
is no doubt
kiss my lips
have the sense
seen a road
pay our love
paints the town
planned our house
say sunday noon
turn your world
is no sickness
tarry there none
come the body
fill your heart
dwelt no freedom
find sweet peace
had no lovin
have five fingers
break my heart
doubt my love
found the way
come on home
touch my heart
locked up tears
tell me baby
needs the innocence
hear the news
go away babys
need gentle arms
say a heartaches
are some things
is no one
let your light
make a living
kiss your lips
kissed the one
throw my arms
stand the thought
scheeming playing games
lose my mind
live my life
help this wanderin
make the change
known many loves
find the house
get a hold
make a bridge
fell in love
got a way
watch good love
let the sun
mix with people
unlock the door
struck thirtysix gallons
got smooth sailing
calling oh sinner
give my love
marvel my love
go through life
watching her life
fills my life
sing our song
falling in love
know the sun
take those pillars
leave me breathless
stole my heart
saw the face
is no need
stole the daylight
forget your birthday
light the ground
borrowed all moonlight
done my time
breaking my heart
changing our world
love the ground
say the heart
change my ways
blow by bordens
broke the rule
come the night
bronach a chaithimse
need the feeling

libertys a welcome
sleepwalking the corner

take those pillars
living reckless aye

loving this twilight
saw a silhouette
feels like love
make your heart
see my baby
bout the things

drinking black coffee
turned his life
hear your voice
deliver the mail
orders wild turkey
watched the coal
said the boys
put the mountains
need you babe
reach a hand
caught his eye
meets the sky
shift my feet
describe the absense
hold on honey
drift at times
hugged his head
kneeling no one
found one day
lost my name
sank your teeth
taste your breath
took his dentures
darling sweet darling
rules the earth
do your bidding
kill our children
find the reference
come the santa
missing coffee cups
win every day
say one love
contend only love
running now time
made your mind
spiral down spiral
fighting stick dinosaurs
notice the hero
became a game
touched a friend
make your advances
sliding glass door
waxing bucolic shivering
polishing his boots
tracks the fractal
glowing showing bones
had a might
choke his wife
slit their stomachs
ask the pastor
got a lot
rode into town
put your head
caught in time
spinning taco chip
pacified by brainless
took my heart
know a man
had a dream
cockeyed their faces
touch the wounds
do the things
write a letter
see your shoes
stay all night
open your mouth
screaming over wind
seen into hearts
run this time
shake some stones
is one thing
see me everyday
asked for life

hedged with roses

call the city
gone astray o
know that santas
blow the stars
share this moonlight
shine your light
is a shutter
took a chair
hypnotized every time
faded blue jeans
dried her tears
made some turns
is a ghost
knew my daddy
beggin for affection
see oak trees
wanna be holdin
matter if people
check your troubles
wait a lifetime
mean stately homes
saying mediocrity rises
got no ambition
think my mother
manage a pop
run run run
have the news
make a movie
need a hymn
bless the light
broke my spine
feel dizzy taxi
is no place
met the queen
heard that beat
danced the night
work but work
changed your life
is a thought
resembles a tomb
miss my baby
given the chance
spend my life
turn the dark

saying those things
saw a sidewalk
taste the sunlight
is a tab
change your autograph
rolls it rocks
call us windows
hanging out downtown
checking my phone
heard a drop
go outta style
finding a diamond
got the style
need my feet
calling you baby
ruin my day
catch a vibe
messed my mind
made a play
pay my phone
ma stick
hit a blunt
ma die
thin the sentry
scorned in darkness
climb the mountains
play the drums
darken my shield
see the eyes
gets the men
made the passion
dims your witching
bright the dawn
grab your mask
searching the sign
knows the whisper
draw a coast
turns out bendless
emptying liquor glasses
honoured great warrior
feel the beat
searching the glory
gleam and dreamers
try in despair
feel no repentance
torn by hate
extinguished arduous future
lucifer master solitude
downturned triangular teardrops
had this vision
tease the minds
high the triumph
enshrined contaminated time
laid to rest
turns black clouds
trained for centuries
burnt my soul
turn the lights
leave my mind
hit the ground
seen the writing
feel the power
call my mama
see the clouds
got a brand
say those words
feel that rush
bet the trumpets
thinking about bikinis
like a ragtop
made this heart
formulating some sort
quit the one
had a smile
see the stone
do when lightning
find a reason
feel like home
get a fever
gives you diamonds
become another day
meant for things
walked your way
is a light
leave the pieces
broke your heart
lay the world
hold that bottle
go hard bitch
letting go time
take your place
saw your face
feel this way
mind the pain
said that love
hide my face
recall those days
watching my face
sold out shows
bet them boys
living for lyrics
got more stones
talking bout trap
know them days
look a question
got an attitude
talk about exs
met my girl
put some shells
know my ends
know what time
talk grease man
pause jerk man
dating one hand
loved my gshocks
see a lot
had a war
rapping for expression
kept those words
reach my hands
graces amazing hands
hurt your mouth
know the way
denying no use
take our time
fill that space
fill the hall
change your love
breaking its way
move a mountain
got these scars
playing that thing
name you deity
get my baby

pick your poison
clouding your judgment
felt a wave
is an anger
seeing the light
bite my tongue
feel that patience
make this work
dance with demons
spend my days
falling like stars
die radiation black
cross the moountains
wound that star
setting sun angels
unmasked at midnight
know the spirit
beating that drum
awake the phantoms
climbs my spine
hear the buzz
left behind haunts
spin skeletal girl
left the witch
made of sand
was a rythm
is no time
keeps the universe
guess the gun
love the way
made his way
offered him millions
cook you dinner
played this game

speak of loss
lay the trip
have a girlfriend
framed that gang
is a priest
remember the soars
torn with halos
lived in lies
created a monster
cried all night
is a way
seen this light
got a price
fixed your scruff
spend the night
takes my life
singing your songs
said the bottom
fell in love
got no idea
find a bed
fire that arrow
got was sympathy
tell me baby
come on baby
got my nerves
buy the crib
love my swag
run deep boy
got some shooters
watched that man
go new day
know me babe
know you boys
play the part
walk the street
recognize the choice
had a nightmare
touch my hand
fall in love
fused tomorrow dancing
composed seven years
knew her lines
outlived the illusion
feel this burning
mean this horny
beseeching the honour
made a gauge
take my time
got your head
burns in desires
hear your soul
falls destiny calls
heighten my senses
is no time
open your eyes
opening old wounds
is a hole
bow his head
fell from grace
hide the sinner
share the tenderest
hear my blood
see a river
believe in love
is no pretense
stripped my heart
having your fun
breathe my joy
turn your back
hear the world
ride the wild
got no intellect
live value judgement
see mr bass
like food food
go on home
take your order
keep on tryin
need no one
know my day
open my eyes
took a look
dance the cancan
need a friend
change the world
say those numbers
thought a lawnmower
sucks this place
know that guy
quit this joke
shook my lumps
let the rain
change the fact
marks the spot
cleared your head
set our course
got no one
load your guns
mention my name
say some day
play on words
call for help
had a sex
find my heart
wasted your time
fall your time
wipe those lips
knew these lives
find the time
used for lust
have a theme
find the world
begin to flight
kneel in front
rise his blood
running into death
breakin the rules
kills for fun
buzzing playing deaths
need a love
hear the clock
believed dissatisfied existence
call it sign
realize the danger
take the responsibility
is no discussion
cause death hits
got no idea
think of things
made your choice
go where realities
gather some people
boiling liquid fire
go the changing
feel the hate
believe in destruction
read the signs
hate the day
pray dead men
begin to flight
show no selfesteem
catch the fall
see the show
fear the opposition
thrash til death
incite the superstition
serve the authorities
got the fire
looks like suicide
destroying mass media
accept  breakdown
ended by mermaids
gone are days
take the land
go your time
studied teachers words
living in chat
hurt when stairs
keep my money
rock dethklok skwisgaar
torn fights concubines
grabbed a flyer
ignited last meal
ride on clouds
pull the plug
accelerate smoke screens
investigate the murders
swim on swim
racing through time
get your piece
fear not death
got scarier fuck
shock a man
take those bitches
talk irrelevant lies
slit her throat
got the action
spit my verse
heard my flows
got scarier fuck
take a selfie
have the shits
bruise ill batter
want nobody ainnt
said youth light
cool my thoughts
wait for love
moving a life
want a man
comes the night

open the door
wearing a disguise
come on ring
break your hear
change my love
catch a bus
losing my complacency
ask the weeds

want some electricity
took your time
set the bar

scanning my mind
ask why zaman

fading my pals
put my arms
predict the future
pay the bills
honor cherish protect
know a friends
going down hiding
run no mercy
seen a lot
lured the men

join the fight
spite your face
keep their souls
coming this time
take the bastards
dancing hard skank
took my breath
let us part
made up lies
had a ball
had a family
is a camera
looking at planet
leave another days
hangs a plane
save a prayer
sing blue silver
catch a ride
shed my skin
kill that light
take a look
drawing my senses
corebut the shadows
changing my name
broke the ties
giving the afternoon
follow the midnight
means rockabye baby
disappear like dinosaurs
seen better times
watch the tower
burn the place
bring the spiral
looking mischievous finding
die no reservation
got a spell
hit the ground
keep me company
walking under skies
spill my secret
lives pixelated lives
following the wish
go one way
blowing a kiss
call my lovers
change the skyline

agree the times
talk in confidence
combed my hair
is a fountain
gee my lifes
listening aloud life
takes a part
loving face smiles
show your love
makes a man
raised in blindness
left a woman
lockit fine makin
heard a voice
say these pieces
watch the revolution
die oh moon
go when baals
shining summer heaven
sickened by sun
increased her weight
bites in pleasure
catch a paper
falling in love
turn my world
hurts again daddy
oo oo dayout
challenge a giant
crashed their planes
throw your head
changed me chchchchchchchange
is no one
getting my facts
is no hold
tried all kinds
keep my love
worm the pain
having a midlife
feel like snow
tell the truth
know from shit
cruise me babe
wasting my time
said the ring
frail slinky secrets
wonder little wonder
looking for satellites
let my letter
dance dance dance
meet to talk
wants a plane
drops and money
breaking my life
had a chance
give me wings
close my eyes
cry she begs
go to finchley
sleeping dead ones
love your countrys
get the train
take this knife
go home gossip

got a handful
feels like pain
fly over mountains
carry the news
sing the chicken

driving from business
ate the food
holds the door
stay that way
got girls girls
closed moonlight shinin
bangin his head
deserves a home
take a walk
looks like rain
put the scar
understand the language
wakes the revolutions
loved a woman
fixing broken things
see an accident
laugh telling jokes
smile when tears
eat the apples
microphones record players
pay no mind
wonder the chicken
dreaming all day
stops everything changes
look my hairdresser
touched the bullet
visit the tourist
opening the door

comes through water
do the graveyard

missed the times
missed my chance
take this heart
cover the mirror
feel the avalanche
took the time
walked the miles
runnin from today
say a word
said as piece
take a look
fix your life
had the chance
hate the way
gave me butterflies
stand the test
watch the walls
watch your step
had the chance
started out friends
running in circles
stop my lifes
striking the rooms
run like hell
run this town

live by fear
accept your fear

talking chases shadows
feels like home
piling the bodies
taste the zombies
hear your future
awaited gore attack
die in pain
returns your life
baptized in blood
torn to pieces
causing terror fear
licking your cunt
rely on shock
is a line
feel the vibe
abusing a portion
share a bond
do your shadow
crossing the line
condemn your soul
justify conjuring power
done a view
begins with curiosity
find a scavenger
see no trace
steal the sun
hide dark skies
set in stone
wake at night
take your breath
breathe givin time
is a piper
breaks my heart
plow the land
walking to market

musing through memories
close your eyes
let the poison
give me chaos
ignites a sea
bring me peace
blurring the line
fear the fever
swallow every word
close my eyes
save us nothings
looking this way
watered down letters
nursed these tears
ravaged skies rain

stayed the bloodstains
bearing vacant faces
seen the arena
let the sails
lead to fear
disabled by fears
craved for intimacy
assailed by madness
concerning liberty freedom
watch a nigga
feel at home
say my name
seeking a sensation
need your love
hear my plea
dying art life
filled with wrath
close my eyes
express no children
got a bottle

take a shit
take my hand
smell like cigarettes
fuck your ivy
forget my name

make a believer
built of sand
fights my identity
laced with pixie
follow the star
gone astray o
wing your flight
reveal the kingdom

had a problem
is no sound
see the line
making your guilt
making the road
made more sense
saw something today
smile of course
shake the hand
filled with freaks
done but life

break my heart
has no name
feel the wind
got your back
turn the lights
chasing the sun
run this town
is one thing
loose your heartache
kiss the stars
makes no difference
misbehave rather wave
fuck your mind
have sexual karma
turning turning turning
cut your journey
remember how cloth
going to bed
forget these politics
want your love
have expensive possessions
forget no one
takes all night
got no kicking
work your body
move any mountain
put the lime
wanna hear excuses
put the needle
cast your spell
said some things
find the frequency
find a window
break a habit
seek hide hide
hurt in love
break a habit
let the music
lose this feelin
forget the past
feeling your electricity
worship the ground
haunting your soul
rot a life
say their lives
come living skeletons
is another side
punk rock gutter
speak every time
calling all goddesses
got the boom
give me tonight
make my heart
love me baby
give our nights
somebodys watching somebodys
took my heart
dreaming dreaming baby
praise his name
is a struggle
are brighter days
give the boy
wash my heart
had my back
grounded your burden
placed your hands
keep your eyes
break the idols
bow worldly pleasures
hide the light
gives me inspiration
miss your destination
live love moment
light a candle
saw your face
change the world
found my heaven
fade away fade
let the eagle
take the road
throw the line
losing your identity
paved your way
left a legacy
go my way
ask your share
send the sun
borrowing a love
take your hand
say oh limehouse
opens its portals
ballyhoo the lullaby
gone sugar candy
lay your cards
waited for tonight
says that love
painting the town
knows what happiness
drinking my friend
loves old tune
make my life
tell me dreams
made my dreams
save my love

made of clay
roaring traffics boom
found your lips

speak your name
had that feeling
sigh a song
had any learning
get a man
known as romance
broke the fall
find the things
care each time
sidewalks busy sidewalks
damned a warrior
deny sinners saints
fight the battle
find the words
live a life
fills the sky
filled with fire
flying on wings
filled with torment
drown your mind
begun all fear
save us tonight
burn the soul
hear the laments
stop the pain
see our stars
see the truth
spin the wheel
feel in terms
see in colour
feels like nothings

heard a voice
tell wild man
show hired hands

lay my head
felt the need
woolwich the tigers

passed the quarry
pulls the trigger
spent in bar
flipping a coin

holding my hand
pay the cost
given the world
left the room
find a way
do on days
watch our bodies
see the future
want your kid
ruin the friendship
bout the future
kick the chair
mind the noise
hide the scars
wanna leave charlies
forget the reason
saw her son
hear the sea
ticking time grenade
find a love
let our souls
keep our kiss
loves his smile
fill my heart
hit the ground
find a place
fletch your teeth
galleries the zoo
handle the truth
take hold hands
waited your breathing
touch and interlock
stroke my skin
jumping breaks sparks
stormed your mind
listen when answers
grow only time
set the time
shades fade fade
reach your lifeline
whisper my name
is a place
find the words
playing a part
let the past
erased my name
staining your eyes
rollerskate five feet
got an organ
got dat boy
stay the course

take a warning
love your features
pull them pants

get my feet
got bad things
hurts like hell
get loud cry
turn your way
begging for relief
see a fire
had a cleansing
absolve the burden
reclaim my sense
see locked doors
fading the colors
change my ways
change your mind
breathing without air
chase the sound
forget the things
holding the key
swallow your pride
got a head
travelled a distance
saw his charms
sign my confession
got a hold
likes my moves
tell her baby
keep my feelings
get this low
turn this car
keep my feelings
give a fuck

started a war
butcher my love
is a country
saw our shadows
close your eyes
told the circling
believe in love
cry the call
lives on silence
hold no harm
confront the storm
stripping your soul
running from salvation
see another junction
sinking my teeth
needs some tenderness
mean a thing
carry the fire
hurt sore feet
been a wilderness
hurt you baby
ran the place
called the moment
gone black gold
fill your life
love the smell
find your way
make your way
turn your back
put my finger
soothe this pain
receive your invitation

got a tiger
seen the light
became the bedrock
dover no honeymoon
lost all sense
lack the wits
keep on burning
remembered in part
care my flesh
breaks your heart
heard the guitars
knew my heart
chosen one sun
meets the sea
let your heart
claim my words
see the libertines
hear those bells
reached this destination
working and breathing
worked many people
found a way
spoilt the view
broke his heart
got her keys
met a mate
made the trade
know what detours
waiting all night
is a method
hear the sound
change the world
move our hearts

took our guilt
done great things
confess our dreams
made a way
began the world
fall let justice
holding my life
took our sorrows
let your kingdom
gave me sight
declare the glory
stop the work
grow our faith
go our hope
pursued our hearts
laid your riches
brought me life
show this world

bring your children
finished my fear
declare your name
breaks the dark
turn my heart
praising my savior
make a way
throne your riches
raised to life
lift your voice
let your glory
need your grace
overcome the world
let your presence
help your love
fill our hearts
is no limit
rise your shackles
is no reason
declare your victory
awaits my praise
lose its power
magnify the praises
open your arms
sing your praise
know your glory
revealing heavens wonders
left my shame
have the heavens
fallen when fear
jesus your presence
watching every gesture
overwhelmed my soul
control what tomorrow
give you glory
deserve the praise
cause mass hysteria
broke my heart
have no clue
headed for earth
raging sea shooting
bored with templates
let this harm
fighting for attention
coming to life
fit another hand
fills my ears
got a guitar
working this day
fall in love
losing my mind
place your bets
headed for disaster
admit to narcissism
akilling my vibe
increase my popularity
wage the war
have a dream
comes this time
move my mind
took my life
bring the sun
hear the voice
have much money
is no one
say a word
seen a footprint
need no protection
stay awake stay
chase the hands
forget that feeling
played the thief
follow their plan
swimming my heart
going through changes
forget the words
feeling this way
keep on dancing
rolling the dice
paint your palette
fear only time
lived another day
traced the outline
let your heart
dealt the consequence
ached with wearyness
waiting oh magnolia
forget his love
chase the sin
face this valley
unwavering god shepherd
whispers your fears
place my hope
lift my voice
kissed the earth
said our goodbyes
see a girl
speak the truth
rolled the stone
shake these lies
come a day
says his heart
help the way
making new streams
dropped her coke

loaded the saddles
breaking my heart
drip with horror
glistening sapling trust
build a rocket

looked like ice
meet your father
turned up noses
shut that door
granted make love
cleaned the ashtrays
fill the spaces
had no media
approach each time
fell from grace
is a breakdown
love some lie
pick a star
seen your brightness
control this flesh
read the movement
embrace the struggle
pull my coat
takes my breath
keep our love
got a name
counted every cloud
steer my heart
find a sleep
had the grace
move the things
seen my mates

took a chance
living like lovers
bestow the gift

destroy my heart
match your riches
keep my ambitions
hanging around leather
wore this disguise
is two sides
got a kitty
use a lift
allowed leaving town
believe no one
came to town
is a change
share the wait
sit and wonder
hauling sixty tons
is only today
strike every frame

stay alone tonight
heaves with pain
had seven wonders
spare the rod
learn wounded birds
see the kids
beat the drum
breaking the sound
got my head
play all day
freedoms a time

seen heavens face
face the facts
scratched a ticket
fuck me shirt
given the opportunity
drink ladies drinks

making no money
filled your eyes
lay around spending

feels like destiny
made infinite love
had some time

breathe this love
see the reflection
devoured me lies
is no way
keep the secrets
break the tension
living the life
want a part
showing no signs
wants a cracker
living the life
call it conviction
forgotten the voice
wake up face
see the truth
got the blood
threw my life
sweat your knees
break our trust
forfeit the game
roam the crying
waves white sand
see a flower
behold the paleness
holding the stars
falling in fear
spun the candle
feel the idea
run for cover
hate the rest
got a boyfriend
goin on ackman
hate the game
get sick wid
need a fix
blow my mind
sell your soul
falling in love

got a handful
wash your dreams
start falling fall

blowing my way
get my fill
see the pain
having nightmares nightmares
open my eyes
know my sins
lose my mind
locked the windows
is a monster
take my soul
hid the light
filled with horror
watch other creatures
returning to soma
got a face
reap the fruits
meet the devil
gain my trust
go insane shameless
believe the scenes
deal the deck
need pleasure trough
swallowed by pride
have no need
understand the crime
want a love
seen my mates
made my life
burn your mark
bring that minute
return my stare
tracing the scars
mix your drinks
is a belly
fall to pieces
reach you tomorrow
kill the phone
throw those curtains
took a chair
broken down dreams
got open arms
have no fears
play with love
games silent whispers
seems like yesterday
come on read
feel the passion
know the feelings
hold your love
jump my bone
leave the bitch
chasing the dream
lala land roll
catch the sunsets
offer a kiss
tortured dreams childhood
carry the dust
faces dark defense
ride the tides
make his mark
comes  hammerin
got a ballad
sleep little darling
raining a veil
go to bed
sweep those blues
covered the sky
suis a toi
takes many lives
gone no one
keep the mic
slept through times
move the crowd
doing the knowledge
set a cup
squeezed a trigger
get a grip
buy my breakfast
say our loves
bring the house
change your ways
throwing my way
living my life
bang the drum
lost his crown
dawning the end
do us part
is no way
comes crawling night
got your finger
find the edge
put a bullet
know that blood
curse their names
pack your bags
saw the light
pull a smile
love your children
find a way
falling down disengage
kill your dreams
getting older eyes
watch my days
left the life
drenched in sweat
makes no sense
tell the truth
pay your time
mean a thing
digging for sounds
pave the way
took a birth
roaming the plains
mind your life
flaring candle light
become as blood
see a lady
see an angel
raise my head
appease your thirst
find another dime
caught in space
close my eyes
depleting tribe memories
wipe your shoes
rock the boys
got a lot
cast a shadow
is a person
cry your heart
rode fiery horses
had a mind
live for times
circling the ceiling
buried him years
imagine stranger things
came a hurtin
came the mountains
stay at home
making a sound
was a time
shook the sand
treasure my independence
approach the shrine
dreaming of home
outlines a sea
broke these chains
overgrown the coverup
is a line
lined with sellotape
call my home
sign your name
count the years
help the feeling
say our goodbyes
loves his friends
skips eight beats
leave a message
lay their bodies
give me faith
forget your faithfulness
reigns your mercy
lose the love
calling my name
hear your voice
focus my eyes
is healing love
start a revolution
gone now years
see the light
is a light
know when time
forgive the light
want a castle
let your heart
skip the tattoo
run around town
running my mouth
called your phone
looking heavy shit
hear another word
met a couple
rule the world
is a couple
have an apb
got no money
need a luggage
got this way
care wasted youth
shoot the bailiff
wishing for rain
stuck my dick
cover your face
got a blunt
say the worlds
pop the trunk
meets a volcano
make my woman
dreaming of death
fuck an intro
know my style
stare at pictures
is an echo
show these mother
cause a chain
got a riddle
living your life
tell a friend
stare at pictures
left the keys
have the attention
get a lot
light that mmmm
push her buttons
understand your body
shared my mind
is no way
moving up wenusele
got some hoes
need drama ngifuna
heard my tracks
call the police
stay at home
let the pressure
take a look
spend your time
let the sun
living your life
knew no right
got five years
living a lie
is no time
have a war
echos your name
showing the cracks
stack the shelves
gave that scar
collect the tears
insert your coin
get your needle
control my face
rented a smile
insert your coin
show your appreciation
save the world
losing your way
freezes and waits
standing like statues
crumpled plastic bag
feel the rays
swear the saint
knew the curtain
get some rest
biting the blade
stop the clocks
ignore the spectrum
keep deferring action
leave my side
dead the life
had a plan
loves the way
leave my side
is an option
drag your body
is no sympathy
walk with shadows
have our night
playing russian roulette
took a piece
make your way
burn your city
turns to day
fall on yesterday
numbed the pain
calling 911 fuck
pray no salvation
got a reason
remember every scar
do no wrong
falling and worlds
hit the ground
do the things
tear your heart
love me beggin
dealing with hearts
found the time
see the sunrise
bite your tongue
keep our feet
see the point
said these words
getting out futures
laughing your body
biting my tongue
left off baby
leave my mind
is a speed
do any good
saw the light
got a job
take your lonesome
done mister state
need a fool
bought my ticket
let my dog
treat a woman
saw you lookin
gone your memory
gone baby baby
fit the battle
wander these hills
bleeds dry runnin
lay this hammer
gone another circle
watch your back
wear your skin
call my name
cross the rivers
said calico county
were no limitations
comes from outta
blow my way
see that shadow
left a scar
turned his lips
drinks mustang wine
theys babies nashville
had some fun
used car lot
got a sixtynine
had a nickel
walking down death
breaking her heart
stand the fire
stay little girl
come on wheels
have your eye
fall in love
is no moon
whine white freight
taken the blame
caring the way
caressed the trees
build a stairway
travel each bend
feeling mighty lonesome
is no one
had your way
hear love call
reach for tomorrow
sing a sleighing
coming to town
let your heart
doing new years
hear those sleigh
said many times
do good morning
shining at night
go to pieces
make my dream
sings through years
tell round midnight
bounce a rhythm
need your lips
cried a river
misses what kisses
fall in love
hear a lark
love the look
begin the beguine
parading my serenading
believe in matter
made your kill
know what day
brought my lover
wished for turkey
got the change
taking my fun
see the light
lost in meditation

find a harmony

had a lifetime
enjoy this night
wear a smile
feeling the way
suggest a license
bloom in flower
seen a ghost
recognize the street
wanted my heart
know your love
satisfy your hunger
words the greet
measure the dimensions
make the outlines
clear the ring
replace the pitchfork
see our freedoms
bear the wisdom
see many things
fanned the flames
rose the children

reaches my ears
opened the play
is a thing
strung his friend
walking my way
know the truth
wait till night
living with pirates
leaving my pillow
break the darkness

took a cup
laugh with love
looking for cause
blowin my phone

attacked by surprise
spend one evening
brought our hearts
lives from day
wants your love
have no doubt
forced the deal
fill the void
take a hold
stay in line
found imaginary ways
hit the ground
walk the earth

brings my soul
believe my dreams
liked the way

lost all control

live in fear
believe confusion conquers
came to clarity
feeling gods pain
lesson the guilt
bite my lip
climbing these trees
give in lie
watch the curtain
remember your voice
hurry these lands
replace this pain
caught in dreams
bleed no time
let this distance
found my way
lost my armor
stay the winter
weep the movies
get into trouble
kiss your ruby
sent his servant
loved you noone
thought of angels
miss your laurel
love stray dogs
fade away love
spendin ten cents
worn and daddy
knows someone noones
see your light
let my arms
get a feeling
know danger danger
flown away rescue
give me love

go to work
take this weight
jus a pour
stay in control
hit the ground
follow each drop
take a chance
hypnotize your body

love me chances
regret a thing
worry cause tonight
took a breath
close my eyes
cross the line
is no way
free the dream
pop my heart
is no choice
gaze up scrap
have my head
stuck to quicklime
crispy black shells
stroke this world
hear the whistle
burnt out stubs
taking her home
got no houston
got a catacomb
sharing this spot
unpacked his coat
watched for hours
petting the carpet
had their mission
let the dog
stay stay today
keep my promises
watched the day
is no way
watch your head
kill the lights
has no switch
assail your graduation
sleeping sound tourists
find your ghost
is no way
makes nervous sweat
is no one
bleed the time
bring your plastic
found a way
lies no difference
know the pictures
is a night
is a dolphin
took two steps
took a subway
move the crowd
left eye spins
die the things
feel the vapor
miss the appeal
had their way
loins my imagination
forget a waste
took my place
wait for appointments
whispered love countdown
score the weapons
kick the punks
is some things
buy the sickness
greeting the rest
made in hell
got a chain
ask the atheists
heard a bone
forget the words
makes in mirrors
prove my point
see a choice
starts no start
let belief fade
take the chameleon
want more love
policed by children
paint the truth
own my eyes
shine the sun
see it motion
choose the way
fallen in love
looking for laughter
have a pair
see the day
hits the street
wrote the words
had a ribbon
catch the eye
pass your face
watched the daylight
do the things
left behind names
need a friend
come the day
see the show
need my help
get that twinkle
see both sides
crying the hours
robs young girls
atalking your future
do the winds
agree one hand
unpacks his trunk
assize poor will
lilting before light
kneel in crystal
sang in tune
knocks down churches
is a grace
view the scene
view the fields
stray in search
see a rover
lead a life
lie low cs
pass the time
sign my father
join the navy
search some hearts
lie low cs
pass the time
follow his dreams
go a priest
started pouring water
turned my back
eating our ghoulash
is been times
ride a stallion
see my lass
whiles her time
change the ways
pass by call
pushing the jug
drive young ladies
open the door
had no daughter
were three men
took an inch
takes its course
lightens my path
set my eyes
took a trip
is certain things
left the shore
feel the rhythm
dance the jig
stand for freedom
tear their blouses
have a tale
found out yesterday
have no thought
cut his skin
journey through mountains
spare my shirt
blow the smoke
join the line
is a picture
view the fields
dreamed a dream
born a landbound
lit the heavens
are many ears
want clear water
hold the ocean
feel this darkness
see the name
leave your nest
call the nurse
got your name
tell the world
find the bars
batt their eyes
bring more light
saw a branch
see the tortoise
starve forever sticklers
making his tricks
burn the cabin
break the ice
is a nurse
react the nose
bitting his tongue
shine a fuse
dragging his feet
put a stick
start their whirlwinds

miss the mark
scratch his head
discovered the wonder
rely the past
lose your mind
said my love
take every leaf
know is nothings
heard before yours
end with fights
leads to lows
felt like love
learnt in school
put my hands
stop it trouble
got 0 emotions
close our eyes
sees no way
see the wood
hear that sound
torn up sofas
illuminate the business
found a partner
gone their evil
cling to pieces
meant your heat
lose my mind
do this kind
wallowing in defeat
sharing the night
cramp your style
take my hand
used to shotcallers
missin your body

catch and bills
take this moment
fall in love
lose my temper
shake the world
bout the end
see the tears
hear your voice
got a hero
cast my cares
live a life
have nine months
keep your life
laughed a lot
walk through fire
calling sometimes freedom
rise from places
seen his power
got my armor
forget time ticks
move and waves
hold my heart
mend a miracle
cried every prayer
is a plan
rushing my way
see ya shame
hold each moment
ending some others
took a trip
walk by faith
done your time
treated like royalty
fly the beast
give me faith
reach that skyline
hold a track
show the people
take a breath
wanna full speed
hold up rockets
spend our life
is your heart
put my dreams
see your hands
see you tonight
feel the heat
watched her pirouette
read your mind
had no pages
is one thing
kissed the foot
held the key
masquerade the worlds
everythings in tune
spread your wings
lay back rest
gone and tonight
give me love
fall from grace
putting a line
show the way
is a point
is no point
won with fists
lay your burdens
turn your back
dance monkey dance
killed every love
play those games
set this doubt
jawdropping center stage
disappeared the nights
tell the truth
hit the beat
falls in love
take me home
drown in emotions
fill a cup
leaving these footprints
hurt you darling
rains the flowers
have no answers
take my place
decided which way
burning my mouth
light a fire
stuck in place
reveal the grass
made of glass
make your way
shaped like kaleidoscopes
see that look
climbing a ladder
wasted journeys time
throw that punch
soften the blow
kissed the blood
wipe the blood
shot the bullet
forget the letters
tell your father
makes no sense
bleeding to death
see these blood
wear this week
wipe the stains
stared into oblivion
live my life
pass the fists
see your face
hate this town
put the power
take my words
feel the need
hold my breath
prayed for sin
swallow this confession
dived for hours
thelei na bgalei

coming home tonight
turn your tide
let the raining
go square go
got home tonight
say the ghost
is no one
do one day
is a zillion
lit the sky
needs biblical integrity
make up senarios
change cuz change
wake up tomorrow
rule the world
see the rain
got the answer
stop the search
had this feeling
pacing the floors
turn to enemies
spend my time
breathe this morning
have their ways
held my hand
walks with persons
sing and dance
making your guilt
making the road
made more sense
saw something today
smile of course
see the life
find the answer
make the scene
help the way
start my search

took the bottle
had that look
wish my memory

leave the light
plays its position
listening to milton
got this look
come in peace
light the city
had some things
stand in line
looking for mistakes
bleed in front
leave your station
playing this heart
speaking a rhythm
wait another day
make all things
make beautiful things
come in love
have my heart
sit with princes
thunders the oaks
turn your face
flooding the desert
let church bells
torn both sinner
broke my heart
gone in search
gives me migraine
made the world
kissing you goodbye
send me evenings
shaking the fatherlands
found that essence
light myself nicotine
worry our bodies
accepts the process
watch new blood
is no way
got the time
seen the pictures
needs no justification
keep my eyes
sleep what dreams
tell the truth
screen the sun
cut the bullshit
lost in space
lived in tunnels
trusts in fate
invent the economy
have no rules
kill the bull
stands magic mirror
harvest the seeds
bust your grill
easing the pain
cast the line
cause the words
reteach with speech
let your conscience
build in skills
create a means
take your time
packed my bags

drink a cup
stifle ya lines

drove for days
take every chance
leaning on words
got no intention
let my future
take your life
see your bullshit
take some time
show no fear
play the game

regret your invitation
run for cover
wasting your life
hide the scars

destroy twospeed cycles
sing a cappella
counts the hours

dwarfing the sun
fills the air
floating in space
broken your heart
filled my heart
call a truce
shows no emotion
turned my mouth
building a fire
get some records
take this chance
broke one string
makes old jokes
get some mining
figures the wheezing
is a woman
live in shit
haunts her mind
live forever remorse
comment on virginity
like the night
fish the tumor
embrace the reborn
making the round
leaves delicate touch
is no ground
whisper my name
know the way
see under skin
keep a smile
need a reason
follow no matter
get some armour
play my insides
merge a vessel
see the sun
came a vision
watching the night
lost at sea
floating the bottom
run like roads
is no time
is a rift
hear the sound
built this wall
mining for light
breathing the silence
filled with promises
falling into harmony
fall asleep enchante
mistaken a shadow
is a fire
leave the light
has two sides
found the wild
hear no good
is no limit
have someone elses
cutting the sides
singing little melodies
get side effects
passes my eyes
had a feeling
waking into waves
written in stone
go the ice
smelled like roses
take the bend
ciphering with fly
spit lyrical backflips
hold ya head
find me knockin
knew a love
is no plan
got a lot
fall every time
take a minute
holding my breath

broke your glasses
put a ring
born the shepherds

hears the screen
wine two shadows
spent last night
picked that spot
recall no dance
wrote our names
came on stage
bathed in weeks
take the heat
give me courage
is no one
see a day
drive it home
fell in silence
hide your daughters
brings him hope
working that overtime
play their request
make the rodeo
heard no whistle
is a ship
came an air
needed a ride
fed our family
decide where tomorrow
sweat the dance
drive to town
trace this call
found a note
shaking everybodys hand
kissed next year
doing new years
cover the ground
flow my tears
lock my door
die in peace
got the time
is no point
take the pills
crack my walls
have no time
like new fashion
bleed but heroes
shut your mouth
withdraw the feelings
stay now nothings
have no welcome
picture the man
show you religion
feel the cold
got the nerves
want the shame
blame these boys
make your picture
listening to life
told me time
singing love songs
laugh this picture
found the problem
like it images
lose these rules
read the papers
remember one girl
like young girls
cut my picture
got the look
do reasons fade
seen tall things
live in nightmares
hide the pain
take my life
take the pain
pray every night
believe the things
put my fear

watch the sunlight
calls your name
do this world
sing no glow
get my mind
believe in trust
sit down kids
cry this way
is a light
search my mind
see the tree
jotting down notes
changed your feeling
say baby baby
let your conscience
fill the radiator
feeling the sweat
take your pleasure
searched my mind
see their home
marching by clouds
deal with ways

running in circles
fell into romance
keep on joking

shines in harmony
tangled with love
has no meaning
knew which storm
untied no time
gone gone childhood
living your lie
amor a thing
is no perception
blowing the fuse
singing a home
stumble into situations

grows yours sinks
rise up singin
makes my love
viewed the morning
is no sun
is always lots
take this ring
hunts my mind
missed a day
falling in love
soar with love
kicking its groove
bless the child
let your conscience
have a hand
set the child
last when landmarks
make a change
find the garden
got a place
chasing the sun
holding a boulder
bind your heart
boomdidi boom boom
falling like rain
go white lilies
feel my pain
live in memories
knows the sorrow
see that freight
give you love
took my love
know our love
run along blues
let my worries
washed my face
hide your face
runs mary hair
run in silence
take one day
come no one
rhymes and phrases
meets nice girl
painted life hallelujah
think the way
go a life
had two years
broke my life
breathe the streets
wash in red
did two times
feel the touch
holding onto hell
find a piece
stole our highs
lose this fight
steal my money
need a girl
echo every word
lost my head
smile and crude
blame the problems
got some cherries
is no question
find my way
face a day
depressed with thing
forgot the times
speak your mind
seems every time
have no faith
skip the night
take this path
losing their souls
love you tonight
care your mothers
got some skeletons
see the sun
stay that way
get my mind
let the music
got one time
have a drink
making a scene
heard the music
close your eyes
round the clock
hang my head
get ready cause
fell in love
chain my life
let this fire
take a chance
heard a knock
rock the microphone
got the power
mute the sound
rock this break
got from floor
start the tape
losing their breath
say its alright
got a history
check the deck
thought our destiny
takes a guarantee
want no one
separate my heart
heed the calling
find his way
quit the fight
come on baby
pay no mind
told your mama
forgotten the reasons
know the airs
said 84 years
see whoa speech
bout your troubles
make my move
make 6 bucks
dreamt last night
dreamt last night
coming next mysteries
got a ways
understand the sky
riding that rodeo
use a cowboy
got the heart
pass the gravy
turn my heart
put the distance
trust your soul
is not nothin
cursing the wheels
is a reason
see your tears
say adios goodbye
put the pedal
cry a tear
take a key
keep my heart
hitting the wall
got a feeling
got no business
is no one
keep wasting time
need a date
took a risk
take a pic
hold my head
got some diamonds
got some act
go shopping walk
got some racks
racks outta state
took that drip
took another one
goin outer space
paid a hell
control the hype
take a chance
have one hood
hear it people
found the love
pick a place
see this finger
watch this things
loving every second
taking this rocket
tell me baby
counting the hours
let your words
burned for love
crumbs your way
living in stills
stop the lies
hurts then baby
hold my liquor
herselfs a box
burned for love
want your fortress
washed up rocks
openended cosmic code
pierce the heart
shine on shine
help me part
sing the banner
fill my cup
carry the weight
saw the ground
called the house
bout his life
wear a frown
fell in love
know the way
wear a business
tell that time
counts the days
hurt my pride
quit for weeks
is a bedroom
saved the train
sail my vessel
needs a ride
close my eyes
see the storm
find the one
saw a car
walk for miles
dropped her boy
fell the earth
whispering a prayer
walks the beaches
guess your prince
come on people
did the things
ending this war
digging for gold
fly on home
lay your head
hear that highway
paying no attention
wishing well baby
call you dad
take i wanna
had no fear
crying all night
play the role
run down bedroom
made for stampedes
spend with family
getting through tomorrow
worry my father
have everybodys waitin
understand the things
tried the phone
got no time
saw him whirr
is no one
meet the machines
sing a chorus
leaves the station
feel your purity
whisper one word
let the light
take a look
live in nightmares
planned sometimes words
put your hate
roll with niggas
cared for solitude
playtimes over muhfuckers
keep my eyes
que la gente
see you shawty
born silent night
let your heart
oer the plains
put your hands
fall down wish
know that times
mean no harm
use your love
hold the key
wrap my arms
kick the covers
rock and roll
go the way
hear me howlin
set a date
learn my line
call a taxi
seen everything baby
kick the covers
let your hair
get the hit
see me comin
running my rig
want no coffee
know a cat
bought a brand
love you tonight
like the way
tell me baby
have no money
know baby baby
let the rest
delay that trouble
threw a rock
see your tears
say my dog
have a blues
let your daddy
rock all day
call him james
bottle this stuff
care 99 days
lock your house
have you nothin
leave this town
got my eyes
know next time
got the house
love you baby
went to doctor
keep on tanglin
rockin out tonight
give up feeling
learn to breath
live my life
allow baby baby
feel the love
got in mind
feel it tonight
had this girl
guess that time
explain that feeling
win this fight
say your mine
suppress all night
seen those signs
have a dream
break my heart
goes my way
turn your back
spending my nights
gives me light
tearing my hair
see beyond today
have much money
win first place
gave me games
found a letter
see the light
fall the ice
playing a game
is no sense
acting my age
get no time
have a purpose
calling me names
meant no harm
knows what tomorrow
want the truth
wasting my time
felt my feet
find my way
end that feeling
watching the time
walk this earth
know the time
see the world
want these streets
touch the sky
say the words
know my heart
take my love
secure my kids
stayed here baby
burning light crystal
drive starlight night
stopped opening doors
did for love
love you tomorrow
go the distance
sinning every day
did your dirt
change my ways
feel the steering
cares white collar
know no one
got no money
pulled to pieces
enter the dragon
burned a ring
take a ride
screamed out kicking
did last year
happen a change
wear sour grins
sacrificed the poem
closes the curtain
let the shadow
reap a time
loves old song
strike the hour
starts a shivering
breathing the cold
break the chain
feel the winter
is no rhyme
losing all control
put my heart
take your hands
grew the void
watch the twilight
hold on hold
throw my heart
read your letter
set your sights
weighing that silver
raise my head
banged my head
have no concern
feel the cold
wait the rain
feel real life
come the weekend
steal it baby
hearing a word
slide sky break
turn the sound
yell the ripple
wear my shoes
take the bend
hear the heart
took my living
close your eyes
entertaining the city
stop making patterns
keep my soul
burning fast time
hold me woman
keep your mouth
is a stranger
touching my skin
passed me everyday
looking for answers
made of gold
know the truth
hear the sirens
lost my way
find a way
want any way
throw a diamond
running from shelter
turns to dust
begin another day
cigarettes frequent flyer
examine every inch
stayed that way
let the slugs
stab your wife
lock your doors
got no phd
spitting the bars
want my space
getting the girls
get your figures
ask your uncle
looking no adlib
glistening greezy mandem
go to bed
speak my name
love the way
tell me darling
comes the hurt
makes no difference
ease my pain
has my name
hate this dance
disappear a stranger
taste your lipstick
dawning sun destiny
gone my heart
hear falling tears
marks the end
take me tonight
take a trip
take a toke
do it tonight
yawning just morning
left the apartment
return the favor
gave another turnstile
hanging in hope
take radical fashion
aaaa hey baby
reflects your face
marked by death
end in pain
choked by liars
falling kingslayer rise
knows the shadow
crowned by minions
feel the need
die grey ruler
taken my heart
need your life
is a way
play that fool
holds a book
shining the children
is a bullet
lock the door
had your suitcase
break your heart
rode into town
missed that gate
got their eyes
make a phone
touch my spirit
miss your smile
is a thief
is any truth
give me time
had a ring
find a light
move my dancing
sit like watchmen
seen our share
smile the way
wrote the book
had a hall
found the kind
smile the way
blinded bye love
see the sun
get my friend
stay our love
come come baby
come the bombs
make my way
feel the change
bought the night
forced into submission
keep your head
get a piece
soaking wet baby
leave the studio
having the iron
try some shit
had a nose
die for ours
blew up man
embrace my power
died every morning
had that glass
hit the scene
give a fuck
gotta race
put a bag
seen a gangsta
got real guns
hit my cause
have a way
turn the news
sings infernal psalms
rise a succubus
moving without eyes
serving messiah son
suffer little children
found on seas
cleansed assembled flock
explore the dark
conquered a magic
hammering the nails
ignite our dreams
sing each year
had a dollar
said but things
stuck the effervencent
come my way
sleep five nights
carries the chains
got a xxx
get the hang
remember this cold
try every day
slamming yours babe
heard their poison
put a fire
hold my hand
got my girlfriend
right those wrongs
drop the needle
hold on brother
had a dream
drops a dagger
fix my heart
stop this burning
lose your mind
find the strength
leaving the ground
define the explanation
took the time
want your body
lighting the space
help bling bling
tell these motherfuckers
take your bum
get money ayy
give a damn
remember me fuck
tell me eeeeeeeeeee
ouuu money power
made the world
got a seat
feel a spark
eyein me tryin
show the world
take a spin
let me rock
want the service
think a guys
see your hands
trust no bitch
speak the truth
changed my mind
seen the skies
sail our ships
spreading your message
leave the curtains
growing on trees
leave my heart
used to fucks
making your friends
take the night
break my heart
doing a favour
hairs my doll
fell in love
turn the radio
dies the rhythm
break an exception
welcomed at walk
know the end
taste a slice
take a second
take several seeds
have your attention
come come doll
turns the leaves
stand make canvas
lost our touch
streets these visions
is no injection
wake up walk
leave behind tassels
look like home
last the night
change a thing
looking for direction
let the colours
find the ground
hear the thunder
count the ways
guide the sea
whispers a shadow
forgetting the inbetween
ending a season
guide my way
hit the ground
coming to life
turn my insides
overthinking every thing
see in colour
means a lot
stumbles another one
set your world
say a prayer
see in color
saw a girl
losing my mind
left your bedroom
bribe the door
got a family
have a heartbeat
hear a sound
sleep all day
free my isolation
whisper my thoughts
give me time
got a lot
take your dance
get your shit
dry these tears
handing out flyers
combs her hair
losing my way
falling the angels
cry for anger
screaming all night
is no sound
stole the outside
leave the light
got my wine
call your name
lay your hands
taught the sun
kill my body
see my kingdom
continues a avancer
close your eyes
call up tonight
got your call
scared at night
watching me people
mind the morning
broke my heart
is a spell
caught my eye
sleep at night
genuflect in front
paved with gold
love your tears
try the leaves
forget the prayers
sing for freedom
driving force love
dream my life
feel the heat
knew the wilder
take your hand
believed that love
feel the heat
following the beat
addicted to pain
hear my story
keeps the wheels
telling you baby
remember the day
touched my soul
blow the stars
stop the world
share this moonlight
loves sweet charity
come on jump
know offers comin
read my mind
wanting you sugar
became the summer
know one thing
starting a fire
shine your light
asking those questions
see what fate
is a moment
made the summer
wooaaohoaa true survivor
leave our heartbeats
watch my heart
take your time
touch my heart
break the night
dropped the bomb
know that night
know your body
tame the night
came along wrap
started this thing
got jealous time
saw you tonight
held your hand
left that life
give me time
embrace the thought
walk a step
granted and smile
told you dinner
change this love
give me comfort
is no way
hear your heartbeat
holding my heart
want your lies
believe a word
keep my mind
love many floods
shut your eyes
speak in vain
shut your eyes
left in silence
come on come
say my name
fight this war
hears my cry
break these walls
forget the voices
looking into darkness
know every answer
failed your wife
turns to glass
find a way
sinking in oceans
build your walls
breaks the surface
give the law
take a while
make your head
looking for jack
tell me inspector
had the chance
come the splendour
move from side
close the door
ignored the signs
call my name
give my heart
waiting for tomorrow
was a message
let the rain
give me courage
leave the light
is no need
drink good coffee
drinking irish tea
got to bed
checking the horizon
feel the waves
lost at sea
heard someone mutter
find the sea
were no others
had their fun
see your face
invade my home
skip de skip
see your writing
learn a crack
got no one
wants a piece
drive a car
had much sense
goin down oceans
fill our hearts
sit in silence
stumble my face
drinking whiskey wine
reach the water
stop my mind
feel your love
is no tomorrow
stole my life
carry on carry
held her hand
know my name
knows the way
mean enough love
break my heart
control treading water
looking maple nothings
got our sneakers
make a sound
made my heart
let the sun
feel that sea
need a drink
feel missed girl
left a mark
have the money
left is molecules
need you baby
bittersweet crazy attack
like the flavour
set a cage
speak my mind
follow just breath
covered in gold
is no need
taken every part
see the light
take this chance
have my heart
borrow my heart
keep your love
broken my heart
save my soul
throw your arms
leave your body
miss you tonight

save your sorries
made my bed
wanted the fire
throw your weight
murkin the kicks

waiting for time

changed out form
is a storm
paint a picture
going through phases
make a sound
hold my ground

like this state
came good fortune
veiled as peace

guiding your voice

blinded by darkness
enjoy blue wonder
crossed the desert
work my armour
show my hell
working man buddha
blame the past
know the change
drown in milk
make this world
want a fantasy
soften the lows
let the night
keep the weather
lay in casts
held your breath
bearing a cross
stay for ages
avoid your questions
realise the time
painted never fades
struggle for air
call my name
follow the path
find my way
ignore the feeling
mould the sense
absolve your sins
found a way
knew the template
deserve the lie
breaking all hearts
keep my heart
fixing this one

took one look
had my share
fighting the forces
sunshine silent thunder
come and friends

found the eyes
have a hold
melts the chill
arrived like strangers
speak like vultures
loneliness empty faces
come on marigold
note a sculptors
make a stand
called our fathers
answer the question
understand the nature
boy the things
skip my regret
had my share
give the eggs
end this night
let that gurl
change the fact
have the time
join the crowd
open my eyes
find the watershed
found my resolve
was a moment
bite my tongue
keep our secrets
got some feelings
think about trouble
let the music
get no sleep
change our feel
take the night
loving now baby
packed my bags
puts her boots
dreaming at night
was a boy
breathe and oceans
building my nerve
slow some people
was peace peace
give me time
having the time
lock the door
move jazz music
got a friend
is a truth
filled with safety
shake my hand
greet the sunshine
find the switch
sleeping with eyes
controls our minds
losing my shit
lost her way
believe the truth
voices the ones
draw another line
saved my mind
hate these days
fall mirror mirror
write the music
believe the truth
take a chance
get my head
writhe in pain
losing my faith
break your heart
lost your time
open the door
open your arms
crushing my heart
share every sundown
see the sun
find the heart
holds our hearts
was a time
believe our hearts
have the strength
extinguish with fear
dying song sound
turning three sevens
lose yourself entomb
do katherine wheel
lost holding hands
solitude in chains
cried at love
affecting our reality
treats a man
wearing a mask
has a poison
come on baby
writhe in pain
sitting at home
need a woman
mourning beach house
praise the sea
lose all hope
disappear from view
turned the tables
saying a prayer
filled with despair
bares a lipsticks
wasting precious time
sparkling burgundy brew
taste the kisses
press your lips
do for tears
tried in vain
tell the world
got a nocount
utter the words
painting the town
bother with conversation
play my heart
went to town
catch your troubles
combine thesen thatn
wear a crown
rip and tearin
thrills the skies

hoping the future

laid my love
headed into town
find the will
drawn out days
find the words
remember that night
feel your embrace
keep your distance
made a difference
fucked up situation
know what responsibility
complicated the lives
change a thing
moved across sea
see anything fade
take every days
determine the way
believe that time
waiting for answers
hold the throne
sipping on soda
changed the world
rape my lovers
steal my heart
kill me tonight
take the fall
fight the feeling
see the sun
hold my hand
comes up tomorrow
find my way
tearing up pieces
let the birds
walking in sand
seen better sights
grow old memory

say the heart
take her chances
see my cousin
crash my car
curse the dark
found a home
believe my eyes
got no time
go now baby
get a witness
find a guy
make a fool
open my mouth
come on talk
keep your company
heard my bull
is a party
love my wife
use my head
write the book
know which way
open the windows
make their livings
see the fall
kissing the girl
fall these rules
believe every lie
created this tide
slip by forgive
let the colors
is a storm
swam a sea
lost its wind
pulsing at night
kicks and bucks
done the hurricane
fighting for mint
made of sugar
say your name
longbefore the lights
dressed in satin
is a lurker
break the sky
open your eyes
adore the way
blame my age
carry me home
save the world
is no need
have the answers
is a power
know that prayeroh
want my trap
test you entities
doing shit rapping
lost some homies
pimping jean jacket
sips 99 cent
knew my name
buy the water
turn to racks
want a mess
waste no time
take your body
stop playing games
looking for love
making a bus
is the ones
feed her kids
given a package
pull my shoes
were white lights
kissed the night
hunted whitetail deer
flies no tree
wrap my head
spins its rings
swaying branch singing
heard a bird
running the doors
spoke the tongue
took a pinch
fell in love
put my gloves
eat the crocodiles
got a tattoo
is no day
made of clay
forgotten country music
dreams the world
turned its sails
fly the wings
turn your back
find a place
deliver the blow
makes the world
is a name
listen these things
feel this way
wait another minute
run runaway run
save me savins
is no time
asked you howyoud
cry the fight
let your feelings
had my heart
speak your mind
change the life
caroline big surprise
find a way
get your gun
pack your bags
chasing the strays
gave that life
want you tonight
get you diamond
tie your shoes
eating ramen noodles
make my list
want a robot
got jet lag
feel the winter
going my way
find the reason
want in conversation
brush your teeth
get your kit
activate your laser
eat your brain
cause this condition
know one understands
need a place
have no questions
sing like elvis
steal your spark
means your love
want your lovin
hide these feelings
hide these feelings
memorized each line
roaming the earth
outta my eyes
take our chances
stop the love
cross my mind
close your eyes
falling in line
saw the light
take my mind
gone where everyones
gliding all day
leave my love
know which side
fall in love
saw my tommy
put my money
have a right
win your love
hear a love
told you summer
leave the barroom
break my heart
recall a box
breaks your mind
plays her tune
circling a star
looked for trouble
mind the distance
right the wrong
burn that candle
move her soul
waters your love
breaks my heart
remember the oak
dance every dance
hear the wind
blows the cane
see the lie
born silent night
let our voices
met my darlin
see my father
leading the way
squandered my existence
gone still darkness
lock the door
feels when pain
make the crossing
let this fire
treated this way
makes a man
took the ring
loneliness only happiness
love my ideal
darlin your love
close the door
wither in place
telling me lies
come far country
giving a voice
catch some blackbirds
ease my pain
make a killin
let the heartache
left somebodys heart
is a garden
see the way
slammed the door
unpack my bag
take my pick
has that kid
left you cryin
got a ways
see the light
left to imagination
give your hand
trapped in lament
said goodbye goodbye
knows my name
go dancing tonight
cuckoos no sycamores
burned my eyes
is a dyin
left this world
see a rainbow
share my troubles
need a bible
hear my plea
calls my name
had a bird
need that chrome
work the crowd
love the way
got your questions
seemed every road
get no witness
sailed the oceans
had a harmony
stoned on love
need is food
notice the sun
breaking my heart
carry me home
left this world
goes to work
feel your frequency
working every day
received your invitation
throw my roses
leave gaping holes
chase the feeling
matter the size
held your hand
cancelled my flight
got the rest
elected nobody votes
know the heart
covered in darkness
missing one thing
forgot my keys
smashing the pieces
glittering ember heat
believe the magic
wait for love

forgetcha the thought
forget my feelings

saving my breath

wait until tomorrow
collide with mars

drinking dirty water
come take control
confiscate our bones
paint black sunset
wait in vain
talk nonstop gimme

wasted my time
freeze and androids
tell this dude
heard him growling
color the sea
give me context
keep a hold
go a space
pulling our weight
got the power
shut your ears
grace my cheek
wipe our memories
stole the chapter
sucked the life
gasping for air
haunted the people
got the courage
everythings a lie
loves the pain
is no one
break your heart
take the stage
lose your patience
want your desire
making a fool
crying all night

burning with desire
led by temptation

rising forces thunder

done by mankind
fighting one klick
tame the flames
facing any fear

ring like bells
blessed saviour callin
oer each time
hold your hand
believe that wrong

shake the hand
working over time
rolling rolling rolling
turn to dust

sent the reds
calling all trucks
got my suitcase
kicked her feet

shake these walls
burn burn burn
roll up boots

raised some hell
let the world
gets us load
settle forever rebels
feel that rush
pay nine bucks
stompa your feet
beats the kicks
hold your flower
fade my life
came a world
living a dream
make believe stories
put your face
have a past
know the answer
hear your smile
dug a hole
deserve the sunshines
numb your demise
talk such crap
see the lights
believe the lies
leave a note
stand another hand
find my feet
leave our game
becoming two halves
weeping warm honey
feeling no relief
clear the way
was no way
cross this sea
handed a man
saw this day
knew my heart
found my way
untangle this mess
calm the children
hurt no one
have the world
changed the rest
give you time
feel your love
let the world
seeking your face
broken every barrier
is a redeemer
take this gift
make my life
heard or eye
robed in glory

take a pill
shed your skin
drank a bit
built of trees
raise the dead
get around things
love the burning
going in madness
laughing now man
got no heart
drink a lot
put your arms
got no time
mourn the pain
oooh these days
gone the sky
miss the glory
see her fade
takes away goodbye
cast in moonlight
hunt the zombie
retrieve that message
saw a piece
slammed the door
ends the sound
did the dishes
love the feelings
find the words
knew what people
find a place
fill the streets
changing our ways
took my troubles
shed a tear
wish the couple
feeling my way
get my groove
checked my bank
feel sad look
forgot her medication
glisten and children
lay the world
see her taillights
worry my father
bought every string
oer the plains
said the night
see every couple
closes the door
sippin sweet tea
let us hunt
look like heaven
got the groove
have a fiddle
is a part
sleep at night
spend the nights
got rice cookin
feels like magic
hoping her harlequin
start a love
hurt a couple
remember every lesson
stalling the hardwood
got wicked things
hate her eyes
knows the smell
loves honest doubters
watch each day
hades the place
call a hole
take broken bones
wait a while
is no court
made from greed
is no break
heard the news
done a fever
curse the rose
waste my time
ate dying grass
wager with bodies
baileys her name
becomes a beast
is a wave
has a train
take a week
got the shakes
bay the clouds
have all things
lose your mind
bear the beat
is no peace
spoke in tongues
call this love
fade on account
change your mind
wasting our time
hear my scheme
behold a love
need time time
hold on hold
got a letter
find my way
fly run races
sink my soul
come up tomorrow
felt the laughter
driving all night
run the motor
got the pieces
feel the hatred
seen these roads
find my eyes
take our place
want this war
begin an intake
lost the feeling
unfold the roads
shape our lives
found a way
watched the year
met eleven years
gives no slack
cross that line
continue their songs
sing our hearts
die as rogues
broke your home
waiting let thousands
sleep all overload
lays a blanket
take the diversity
hate this song
concealed though trial
draw the lines
feel the poison
go my head
begin the skip
take some time
found that time
are already roses
make no sense
dies with light
told an overdose
did every step
see my eyes
leave my lantern
have no lip
had that song
remember the shirt
hide your matches
took some time
took the cowards
spend the day
someones a hero
love this time
do wrong tonight
change your eyes
caught on fire
blows a fuse
waste a lifetime
want this love
needed a lover
got a feelin
believe a word
keeps on cryin
understand my man
know your love
find the key
mean the world
shared the love
say a prayer
talking to girl
dance dance dance
creates love desire
tell the world
give your love
let our hearts
forgot your name
use some lessons
done keeps comin
washed my sin
is no one
take the world
have your way
last a lifetime
fear no evil
confess the beauty
bow every knee
is one thing
give him glory
adore beautiful one
wake every heart
living for eternity
fills the sky
earn a moment
set the world
lose your soul
take the world
set my feet
sing the song
is a place
let this nation
lift your name
put a smile
paid the price
set my heart
imagine all creation
is one thing
got your back
feel the way
win your favor
tilt your eyes
feel that way
comes your chance
roving the sapphire
prime their bodies
take a walk
keep a lookout
runs dry salvation
let sleeping dogs
looking for love
mess my hair
stole my thunder
define sweet wonderland
garden the grass
struggling with demons
heard your laughter
weaving his magic
know the pleasure
bred like beggars
come other peoples
feeding the dinosaurs
dreaming of yesterday
is an ache
spook the horses
leave this swampland
burn the witch
get that schools
want your ex
changing the station
watched the planes
get down baby
made the hour
stay the night
had your heart
close your eyes
need a change
shine the winds
wait the world
kiss me wreck
crossed that line
playing on repeat
make a wish
picture a girl
open your eyes
disturbing tha peace
got tha game
put your hands
get skull drug
need no words
thought the love
understand the pain
give my soul
change your mind
question your life
feel the sun
denying my ghosts
wash my soul
walk on rhythm
have no fear
end our fight
is no life
trust your senses
is no love
feel this way
programmed for perfection
mind the walls
know this place
come this way
line the boulevarde
fooling anybody fatman
slips a film
shake me babe
makes an end
lost at sea
join the team
makes no sense
were no tomorrows
hold your head
found old memories
break these chains
shake down shake
is no mystery
touch the fire
make a deal
take a fool
see these people
know what time
love the way
want you baby
see the light
close my eyes
take my water
draw the line
got your hands
know my way
keep the curtains
make a move
tell the others
believe a word
have a heart
want your sugar
look a lifetime
guess your mama
comes true pop
fake brave face
hold your hand
bury my body
bite my tongue
have a pulse
imagine the magic
let the light
lost a war
ignore the truth
let the water
need it tonight
want one thing
call my boo
trust no ho
fuck my homework
know these hoes
forget my actions
see an angel
stack stack stack
open up girl
cause every time
pick up pick
got no girlfriend
put the pipe
tell the world
leave a bitch
kiss the one
was a bond
hear my name
found your holes
swear this time
keep my spirits
take its toll
paid my dues
see these days
lost the death
fit the mold
move the nightmare
fought the occupation
live my life
find my way
change your ways
took a chance
read three years
come on dance
feel this way
ran a game
have none whoa
carry on love
want it baby
get this fedio
trust a friend
losing my mind

knew the way
busting their ways
make some room
stole my wife
made your love
know that forevers
ate my heart
wearing your sweater
got the music
hold on hold
keep the love
glisten and children
have no place
say time flies
doing new years
deck the halls
close my eyes
dreaming at night
done spinning round
take me home
got our castle
saw the way
push the sheets
have a ball
own the right
lack the truth
speak of sex
shake it baby
walked in time
faceless busy phones
tell me baby
preferred the sea
wake up boy
got some money
ran to wine
waiting for superman
call your boys
scan the radio
show her brothers
is a kid
have a sheet
spoke of rainbows
heard a car
say say somethin
slides the door
watch the clock
wake in fear
is no way
taking a lot
makes the devil
singing soft summer
have a woman
gone my love
done my brother
make much sense
had no food
watch the world
eyes each others
throwing the weight
turn to dust
running after shadows
turning her pale
ripping my flesh
feed our soul
see our destiny
stand the beginning
walked for hours
took the light
feel the pressure
pushed the button
find mother shelter
drop my guard
slice the pie
getting in return
comes the moment
make your vow
knows no one
hope these moments
won the fight
falling for lies
feel the story
lose my heart
closing my eyes
got power power
filled these shoes
playing with love
lost your way
fall in love
lost your way
come to life
playing every song
hold your breath
have ears baby
move my dancing
sit like watchmen
seen our share
is a hurricane
tell the smoke
found their place
set my clock
tapped her way
turned a circus
walk this suitcase
took our chances
find the garden
hear the stars
burns the stomach
digging for secrets
jump the gun
turns to water
take his brother
get the crunk
pills my foots
got the coke
miss the bullet
put ya tongue
play the pimping
s the deala
check check check
speak the truth
live all night
secrets the back
embrace the curse
fall in line
write a battle
kiss other boys
make a name
find a place
outta my head
comes to mind
waiting all systems
show you pictures
chimed my return
passing where darkness
made of funeral
blackening the sky
stand the floods
blow all frost
drop a def
challenge a mother
propel to pole
hate this one
proliferate the type
go back life
eliminate the flow
rock the earth
stay at hotels
is a market
blocking the sun
begun the beginning
seen in life
save ya soul
got no strings
kill every child
get him outta
building a crime
fucked yea yea
shake every time
conjured the dawning
serving the system
built for eternity
riding on fire
insane dangerous joys
ruling a throne
protect the law
watching the mountains
give us peace
comes the bride
bring deliverance fate
take your life
stand the line
running fast decisions
end the tyranny
falling in love
investigating the mind
takes the mind
pumping the beat
made of circuits
hear the legends
win in sin
got no place
striking a match
found your mittens
found your name
make her dream
take me home
sleeping her fever
gone all star
passing afternoon summer
see a woman
line the road
carry your babe
lay no hands
give this stone
made of smoke
wipe her brow
protest the cross
is a house
got a telephone
waiting for day
live pitching glass
left the ground
had a quarter
has you boy
take the wings
say these words
are all kinds
is no way
lay your pistol
is a wind
made the automobile
homeward these shoes
see my family
hide like kittens
sold my soul
is a woman
ate a bowl
gave a damn
playing my cards
face another day
understood his fascination
make a escape

remaking our hearts
believe the lies
find a way
screaming for redemption

run in circles
get to feelin
look for love
is no way
got my headphones
get the chance
understand the truth
got no right

bout the games
pumping for love
took a ride
lost my mind
got the world
heard before trust
comprehend your head
everyones fine fine
telling my brain
missed the point
hid my heart
last a while
brings me fear
stitch the doctors
sleep each conversation
close your eyes
light a match
got one thing
fall like rain
pierce the skin
take for word
floating down escalators
trust my gut
judge my character
escape my love
read my heart
catch my breath
manage the weight
come the light
take a hit
point the finger
make the call
had no choice
shot a man
get no sleep
sleep my blues
obstructs my view
drain this ruin
part their whispers
come with delivery
wanting higher wanting
felt a spark
laid my eyes
lose my mind
act the way
let the rain
need the moment
hurts dear head
dim the aroma
ride the bike
knew a love
lost all hope
feel the love
forget me tonight
counting every moment
filled with sound
get the chills
see your eyes
cried for days
embrace the strength
breaking are feelings
separate your mind
fear anyway nothings
hate the way
wanted this times
asking for help
erasing your face
feel my rage
give me strength
felt his presence
damn my lack
mourning the temporaries
judging the breath
find the truth
does your glory
made for love
pledge your allegiance
know the need
stacked ten feet
pray for judgment
ridicule the one
baptized in filth
break my fall
get away temptations
has the power
make an incision
find forgiveness kill
drag the nuns
set into place
behold the future
destroy their creator
spew bodily fluids
lies the gate
gathering the implements
drain your heart
harvested for pleasure
reversed caesarian procedure
crave rape dissect
ruins of monuments
is no death
grip the kingdom
conquered the grave
awake my love
ooo your love
lift my eyes
low the king
made the worlds
obliterate my fathers
foreseen rebellion flashes
raise your flagwear
bring our light
crushes his oppressors
mind a containment
fill our streets
embrace the apocalypse
give me strength
criticized by friends
take a bite
live a life
realize a reality
trapped in division
fallen from grace
fallen angels death
pass the line
open your eyes
put some visions
hear the message
want a fight
gone your sorrow
lean your head
fall my heart
run in circles
need the wings
suck the truth
embrace a star
disgusting little freak
is no way
neglecting your gift
cry when things
watched the tide
figure a formula
keep my eyes
keep the rules
keep it chill
gave you permission
get the wrap
seems my cards
suck my twinkie

come along stop
confront the faceless

burned my skin
claws my soul
rejoice his name
open the doors
regretting solitary life
cursing me bloodlust
fall like rain
filled with gravel
is an absence
defend her case
collide coerced coexistence
beg for mercy
care one lie
dodge this roar
fall our adaptation
hide my name
lost the spark
despise the outside
stone a rebirth
like the way
smother their fires
drowning the shore
find a solution
left is lies
feeding on life
diminish behind enemy
play with innocence
ignore the mirrors
have a mission
ease my mind
falls with denials
staring into truth
feel unbreakable lie
seen the seas
left behind sounds
follow the river
do the things
adjusting the level
put my fears
felt the answers
let the day
close my eyes
live the life
leave no trace
belong seven days
filled with rage
breathe slow wandering
see a thing
call my name
cut my throat
find a home
pass the memories
left a hole
burn the world
is a void
hear the calling
writhing in pain
gathers the clouds
heartrending your nights
lies the autumns
acts the wind
learnt world forces
came sweet scent
close your eyes
consider the weight
shadows mere remnants
thought that love
bear the flowers
filled with sorrow
engulf the land
revel and feast
reaves my senses
crept inside brief
choose your love
lose your head
scanning my body
hold my head
lose my shirt
play the beggar
ripped in front
tell a lie
got a piece
found a way
hold my hand
wait for love
change the way
stand the test
has no secrets
change your mind
walked away life
leave your side
found the reason
fall in love
change your mind
hold my tongue
broken down romance
made your getaway
find my faults
glide the planes
looked my baby

have our convictions
gets venomous storm
looking a lot
crossed the border
passing the day
cross the floor
drink that poison
take a bottle
take a sip
walk these streets
prayed for rain
made dry land
is no place
kept that night
lies a garden
borrowed sunday suit
grasping at straws
rise up rise
see a man
tell me brother
coalesce with mine
take my silence
take mind body
did when youth
shines a half
unlock the door
cause you destruction
hold the doubts
raining sick riferee
let your water
break the boundaries
take our time
broke with friends
let go roses
took my hands
started the day
attended young school
know why girl
cause the way
kiss you girl
save the day

chase the sunset
read your mind
intervening no meaning
raise the roof
knock the street
broke your heart
rains and pours
giving me caution
crush your successes
find a mason
give a fuck
change my taste
reminiscing spittin fire
trapped inside space
get them cheques
chased the sunset
let the past
slow my nights
lit a candle

got more hamstrings
runnin on sunshine
got red clay
take a ride
get away way
is no rewinding
saw the light
make a brand
burning greedy red
bleeding the rise
understand past midnight
plunder with blades
roll the dice
loosing many battles
watching the news
bless the child
flooded every soul
believe in worldchanger
was a time
control the fire
blessed with thunder
gave me promises
finding a reason
entertain the smell
cried for mercy
coming your way
raise the demon
building your world
sailing stormy water
scream for vision
lies the chalice
stolen the day
know the feeling
got the fire
talk to strangers
love the night
like the dark
speak of winter
played the music
rhyme the story
brought the liar
born the son
remember those days
feel the starlight
sending a message
sands the hour
lost my soul
was no hope
winded blinded earth
fought the evil
bleed your heart
taking my chances
breaking the past
is an angel
rises the life
need the mask
shadowed every land
walk the earth
roll the dice
take my eyes
broken warm hearts
risk your reputation
provide mortal soul
see your light
wish upon tonight
is a moment
paint your palette
live a life
desiring holy wisdom
go our way
hear your voice
close my eyes
keep my mind
see the sun
come little baby
oer the plains
see the joy
said many times
lay to rest
lay in fields
hear the angels
adore him o
held in silence
go my way
searching the lines
left our heads
wipes the tears
sharpen their beaks
wanting tragic ends
feels like home
understand my reason
tell my story
stay and seasons
tow the line
see your face
run in circles
takes my hand
moving slow wooah
haunt your mind
is no classes
left my coat
beating that heart
stay the way
have secret places
become weak life
is a lion
keep their coffins
see me drift
know a thing
lost at sea
going there lady
calling different cities
stay the night
build my world
close my eyes
go ahead girl
do this one
felt this feeling
save the tears
know the stars
cross your heart
forgiven me time
knock out girl
call me king
burst in flame
falling in love
felt a wind
go to hollywood
float in love
gone in darkness
is a love
made the tears
say the love
recreate the times
took a bite
feel a thing
came made sense
bout the words
holdin that fire
take a ride
wasted your time
know the rules
watching every move
got no diamond

had wet hair
crossed the threshold
forget their blessing
wear old clothes
need air air
need the light
found a way
causing the chaos
threw my hands
close your eyes
fall to dust
waste your time
see the people
pretend the sky
dreamed that love
swear the sun
missing your touch
tilt your head
kiss my lips
is no way
stay strong fight
enjoy this world
speak the truth
lost its significance
ripped away emeralds
became an ocean

know that love
needs a friend
play this song
wants more money
turn your day
betrayal the moon
got the shakes
is a vulture
gone the staff
survived the sting
put my fist
watch the world
shattered poor plastic
takes my breath
know this universe
gunning on desire
leave a light
is a light
call his name
makes no demands
try your love
break the walls
fight the magic
wake this world
want no war
come on dance
know your place
standing for injustice
use the force
make our dreams
spend the night
need your name
live this life
moving speed freak
put our minds
spend a lifetime
hooked up baby

swims in blood
chasing honey bees
broke my face
twist the sun
want your candy
thinking of love
take my time
see people candy
find a place
send a heart
cracked up years
took my heart
is no need
got no fix
glow like stars
living like dirt
dry your eyes
awaken the worship
let your kingdom
lift our voices
hear this song
clothed in majesty
letting my dance
take the world
need your mercies
forget your love
sing your song
see his love
let your kingdom
encounter the love
lift your voices
hold the universe
gave your life
clothed in rainbows
captured my heart
cause your face
see your face
fill our hearts
take your word
blows the trees
have a plan
stand with arms
breaks the darkness
is no love
feel the mountains
steals my heart
let every heart
leave our past
bore our sins
sing your song
stop the singing
outrun this heart
rising rising bursting
let the windows
make us one
see your grace
singing your love
invade this earth
overcomes your love
love my one
have your way
is no end
is one love
is no way
flowing from emmanuels
turn into revival
left his throne
make a way
decides my story
win my war
cross those county
keepin on keepin
earned a couple
take your hand
walk with style
like the way
tell me lies
shuffle that shower
know your face
work my names
is a belt
want big fight
seen the sun
threw a bird
feel higher feeling
scaring the sky
sold my women
cut the arrow
pass her land
catch my trout
become the cream
traced one day
forget the days
was a place
slip your mind
pass her land
leave one somethings
pass her land
feed these things
live a life
representing a face
have these walls
feel that wheels
peel the sound
blasted the moment
sending a dummy
emphasizing these things
regret my past
is no ground
reach the field
reached this conclusion
missing your thoughts
sleeping all night
got a care
sing this song
feed the light
have no similarities
work in fire
is only death
start a fire
surrounded a jail
steal your life
goes blank life
leap your bar
floating shapeless oceans
spinning the world
blaspheme my name
put those thoughts
is a future
find its way
feel your lines
control the chance
got it baby
lay your head
wrap my body
open your heart
look good tonight
got this love
hit the floor
fall in love
comes a time
got it baby
get the mood
needs your love
winning living life
want the kid
wait another minute
need a thing
shadowing the scene
take these vows
gave your love
move a muscle
know my heart

put our love
woo super love
got a problem
take my hand
shake the hand
loves sweet melody
gets around swear
take good care
going out tonight
love me tender
know my name
let my enemies
clap your hands
felt the strain
have my mansion
is no life
worship you o
is no trial
love my enemies
see my face
walk the walk
gone on home
flies from montgomry
pin your blues
flashing their lights
had a baby
freeze my mind
saw an accident
had no idea
see my baby
close your eyes
build a house
broken the speed
won a ribbon
hangin around hangin
make her mine
gone to mars
packed my bags
say other lovers
love love love
got a way
have a care
becomes a rose
is no place
pray each night
said our goodbyes
like her eggs
was a note
pack my bag
wore a seatbelt
roll along sweetheart

marked our trail
get my life
drove that wagon
cut those curfs
spent all day
got a song
made a pact
gain my lords
met my fate
was a baby
pounding sledgehammer night
learned a lesson
singing the blues
suggests the blues
wanted every word
hide the man
hurt my baby
knew this love
ride my pony
try this love
keepin her eyes
see my baby
go down swingin
keep an eye
puts her hairspray
knocked the table

giving faceless men
let the memories
let the change
take my hand
pull the trigger
find the rainbow
jump through hoops
come on melt
needs a change
carry the heart
looking for love
touch your body
leave the place
believing in commitment
bury your head
feels like fire
create an image
see the shore
called high hope
buried a seed
see the breath
stay awake stay
keeping the peace
lost my place
writing your lines
make a mess
believe for peace
returned to sister
crashes on morning
paint our shadows
know a place
wipe my eyes
speak your mind
stole my crutch
find a reason
feel the way
master me alot
is no one
burning your love
hide your memory
feel the devils
stay my soul
gone to bed
forget about love
hear this sound
turn your water
found no ones
believe in dreams
buy a bag
disappear disintegrate tonight
throw a bucket
trade a bottle
fade away freedom
failed the way
repeat the words
died my hair
was no fear
get high look
have a purpose
find a way
is a twist
fall the way
filling the space
connected to death
wear cowboy boots
walk on water
like the way
miss the zoo
puts her dust
left my soul
is no way
find a way
hold the void
is no room
made a fool
was no song
beethoven conducting goodbyes
is a slither
hitchhiked her way
see the sword
die though people
put a spike
spoke of kids
wanna play football
said the family
hid away sister
see the road
waste my time
see his face
turn around time
hold on jerry
love the way
tears your picture
comes the war
paints her toenails
found a home
wags her tail
mean a thing
was a pearl
dreaming sweet flagstaff
had a touch
made of cheese
wish this world
let each day
let my piano
carves your name
see the ocean
got a house
begging for grace
hate the ghost
wait a minute
made a mistake
go the distance
heal these wounds
call your name
need the break
look on mes
showing the dangers
gone the moth
splits novembers sky
see the medal
haunting me abacus
turn the dial
steer just sail
take this walk
come back tomorrow
hunting the ideas
given us heart
got a voice
talking more reason
cover your mouth
falling signs uncertainty
go the followers
have another chance
watch the door
moving another meal
bleached the wind
pushing the shame
take this stop
comes to flesh
deliver the racy
take this stop
meet her family
meet her family
take a picture
got a lot
change my mind
left your apartment
control the places
ruined your blacktie
do a demonstration
treat a friend
make my world
riding cross country
touched no ground
left a light
got a trigger
watch your tounge
bite their tongue
love you baby
let your bangs
feel this way
was this king
have your way
lost in love
fill this house
let your love
paid my price
is no one
feel your heart
got this love
feel the water
like my jeans
see the world
making the years
put the windows
cause the people
upset my mom
going insane hiding
go through storms
own the night
feel alone tonight
trading my youth
find green eyes
living my life
going to mars
cause the people
love no one
think my city
bout my lover
hung the moon
have a change
run for cover
sleep and day
pack my bags
know this country
had no one
is a bird
took your kiss
dawn the world
havin the blues
paint the town
need the dark
traced his footsteps
standing in line
let the breeze
know my heart
had someone waitin
have my day
forget the past
fade away fade
call it country
pull my hair
got two arms
see that guy
buy the ring
tween a woman
break my heart
had a man
heal my mind
reds her name
hide my love
see our eyes
find the one
call your name
mean a thing
came this morning
build a bridge
have some fun
cried the times
feel the taste
connect the dots
take the chance
waiting a while
follow your steps
block the pain
shoot your ideas
fades to day
catch a moonbeam
splitting the difference
shrugging my shoulders
hiding your emotions
thrown till kingdom
hurts in ways
want good love
know the truth
let our lips
loving all night
eating good living
know that love
heading my way
mean a thing
leave tear stains
grown so girl
is no place
showing my love
know oh baby
kissed your lips
ease your mind
hold my head
spread my wings
keeps me condition
sweep your silver
sing hallelujah love
break my heart
satisfy me baby
find my corner
quit your love
sleep at night
laid my heart
pack my bags
is a time
rock n roll
had my game
turn my upside
know a fortune
told the people
heard some music
brings the light
say the blues
happen some day
lost your way
left no time
is a house
stompa your feet
put a spell
wrap the night
ends a clock
fill my head
have no money
find a way
is a change
have a clue
made and cash
had my dreams
gimme the love
called for days
answer the door
traveling long ground
catch the weather
treat your mama
read the papers
cracking the blinds
reads the sign
get that hurt
take the cure
sleep at night
tell me boy
expect no favors
hide the body
mean a thing
pose no danger
seen the light
met will rogers
take my cadillac
blew every weekday
plant some maize
come runnin daddy
have a dollar
sell the rights
get your hand
quit my job
leave the house
misconstrued all hell
hung down papers
took the stereo
is only mine
go last night
burn the candle
crossed your lips
heard the motor
kick the gas
keep my hands
take the weather
dumb ass line
put a wall
move my body
bring the death
see my baby
get careless babe
feel like elohim
care no cares
bring you happiness
thinking bout love
lie awake thinking
tappin your feet
lived 900 years
broke another mirror
behave my heart
harmonize with love
win the admiration
drop my guard
stop the music
turn your world

love you today
love getting love
got your number
rolled up socks
known the battle
greets the man

comes a rainstorm
turn your lamp
is a view
love me baby

cling to love
pull the truth
take the empire
feel that chill

struggle in life
hits the snooze
stacks fresh paint

cruise around town
got the tailgates
call me country
bout those stacks
jacked up truck

had a fight
close my eyes
close my eyes
have your love
fumbling my words
have no reason
begging you girl
playing a game
kickstart the drama
wounded my heart
think about love
meant every word
is this girl
flying reckless tonight
slamming the doors
cross that line
dreaming my addiction
is no need
find my way
dream its body
locked into place
scorned with death
buried at sea
see your death
fabricated god sadism
leaving mass audiences
made formula hatches
overthrown by tyranny
built upon capital
set in years
ignite their faces
breeding no life
desiccate a sombre
continue their domination
muzzles the lips
convulsing in dehydration
consuming the broadcasts
spits a cesspool
failed concocted plan
hear some noise
pupupull the pin
runnin the game
chaos you shoulda
get your throat
take the pressure
have the chance
know the opportunity
caught in yesterdays
see your point
come my way
want our love
turn your fiction
treated this way
forget about yesterday

prances the hills
favour a girl

done no harm
comes your ghost
hear a love
carry me home
washed my sins
sell your paintings
remember your lips
chill cold steel
rang with childrens
changed familiar scenes
turn your face
find a damsel
carried my pack
courted a damsel
watch the swallows
cross the valleys
hold my hand
see the boats
watch your back
leaves my salt
erase the letter
stop leaving tears
pass the time
crawling its way
is no need
have i wings
asailing with trouble
stole a stallion
sing love songs
stands your orphan
cross the ground
believe in prophecy
gone your love
separates the widow
need another place
wear a hat
following the summer
sang amazing grace
took the rest
laid my eyes
baby your love
find another lover
close your eyes
do the things
love me tonight
have no fear

heard a sound
hoping maybe time

cut a star
write a tune
spoke those words
anticipating your arrival
let the wind

got a ways
got an hour
running with speed
take one leap
own the sky
make your past
falls my baby
changed into diamonds
find your way
built a place
hear your voice
fall in love
forget it man
streaming traffic lights
given easy time
holds her thighs
take the pain
move your lips
drops in disbelief
seems every time
falling to pieces
wrote this song
feel the breeze
fell in love
let the groove
keep your eyes
send your heartbeat
got your dress

spitting diesel fumes

sweepin the floors

going for broke
going wild hearts

dangling your feet
make your friends
pay attention pay

tried my hand
watch your step
lost in song
collide with love
made our exit
reaching your shore
need another reminding
remember our hands
got a mind
steal the light
rings no one
change a thing
is no one
learned in laughter
set your sights
thirst for innocence
shed some light
saved my soul
see a girl
had my pleasure
change from age
runs and hides
restore every heart
is a hope
hear your voice
restore my heart
touch their harps
have the power
take this heart
saying the things
come for fate

wipe my tears
shining their toys

play the cards
sharing better days
got a feeling

gave up cigarettes
bit a bullet
felt her body

looking for love
lose my mind
moan the blues
is no pleasure
see us sittin
walk on streets
seem those days
let my heartache
count the reasons
make a bridge
skip a rope

got a cow
start to treatin
playing a honky
allow that passion
get the picture
found no reason

know a lot
hold my hand
laying awake angel
lost and cryin

changed to winter
take every turn
run the bridges
seen this road
watching tv mum
turned my back
saw your face

break your heart
make your move
underestimate the condition
stand on top

watching your eyes
become the joke
see one shot
sleep every night
feeling her rhythm
need some company
got a body
make is history
is a tear
found the evidence
open my chest
go to sleep
cross my fingers
live this lie
lay in fields
hear sleigh bells
hang the lights
let your heart
have no place
learned my lesson
believe a word
take the game
see another day
is no sign
cross a border
cured by herbs
have your story
made of love
called my doors
see you baby
know that love
take your guitar
watch over baby
fly but love
losing my way
leaving the past
saw a shadow
funny little feeling
get no rest
let the sun
save the world
find the earth
came to town
thought our joy
bid the world
find a way
have i sisters
missed the opportunity
surrounded by illusion
play at love
makes the winds
catch the sun
change your life
share the joy
screening the calls
say fascinating rhythm
nod your head
reach the door
thought of tomorrow
escape the ghost
wrapped in ribbon
had a river
let your heart
like the cold
born silent night
hear your name
bring me heartache
ringing my telephone
give this song
breaks my heart
hear a word
minding the willow
hoping for years
set the world
burns like rum
had a feeling
see your halo
make my systems
dreaming in silver
hate myself tomorrow

watching you times
wait hoping time
thee the seaside
lingers on tomorrow

stood in line
became a candle
see these lines
rising sun snow
beat my wings
say her love
open the windows
falling in love
run the death
missing the point
let our worship
holding the key
bend my knee
defined by mistakes
return to dust
lose my way
find a way
make a friend
coming to life
is no hiding
come let earth
shake my head
bring the kingdom
see the smoke
hurts that love
makes all things
believe my sin
puts a fist
makes all things
makes all things
see the baby
born the shepherds
put the piece
take my body
banish my appetite
petrified old wood
needed some company
see the man
think the road
say a friend

watch every word
takes a lifetime
call your mother
tell the lights
unlearn a lesson
see a hammer

burn my mona
was a bang
take my love
dejected crestfallen griefstricken
having a voice
get any rest
blocked the cops
radiates off skin
beating my head
see your face
roll their eyes
dream this night
saw the knights
played the riverboat
adopted a highway
climbing your tree
spend three dollars
fall in love
shakes the stairs
break your heart
riding alone town
set the sun
played a part
wrestle on tv
got a key
hear your laugh
aimed my scope

grow the lilacs
watched the cattle
have a cup
heard of folks
see his woman

hear the voice
tell the stories
watched her son
is a man
controls so manys
ordered the jugs
turned the water
left the place
train train train
form a table
made a string
walk the line
grit my teeth
leave this town
found a place
stares with envy
wear the black
had another helping
called a bushranger
crossed the land
came the story
growing fast passenger
heard the report
swelled its chest
sing a sleighing
shoot fire crackers
see the way

traveling all day
buy a bushel
going home snowflakes
make a whiskey
seen each giving
comes or hell

got a boy
called a triceratops
went to rest

remember the time
have the trees
lose all hope
writing hot cheques
do unto others
known a lot
aching bones wings
raise the dead
say the end
spent the night
watching every move
get the blues
forget the day
suits my clothes
surrended the confederacy
wore out bow
went out lookin
reached dry land
tell the sugar
smiled a smile
bring loneliness sorrow
tell you folks
took my touch
following the footsteps
got your heart
feel a hand
keeps his window
walk in truth
lived a sinner
built a wall
raised her face
meet his friends
buy a ticket
took the time
barbecue my ribs
someones life sun
fighting for justice
get the blues
spinning through space
run on coal
s the way
pay the price
let her blow
help the beast
got a friend
jesus my souls
got the number
lived where churches
stand my ground
found her holdin
hear me cryin
said one love
soothes my thumpin
see a darkness

have their moments
killed a man
find the place
got your reasons
go down suicide
see dr death
read my mind
got a song
heard the laughter
manage the problems
found a home
loves crazy game
let my love
shackled in chains
hold my body
gone into rooms
had some time
see my redeemer
went plumb insane
had his money
die the day
cry for water
get a chance
bought her things
seems like yesterday
picked wild roses
got a pain
saw that giant
sing your abcs
fall in love
living on gods
take another stroll
have a sweetheart
comes mary hair
set my soul
built the country
ride with sword
lose my mind
leave that junk
carry the weight
heard her engine
help the man
kiss my lips
is a fountain
had your fling
got a promise
grow simple words
got swinging doors
touch my heart
met a girl
runs mary hair
hear this song
saying its time
stayed at home

chasing a ghost
holds my heart
lose your faith
behold ancient genes
consumed my heart
leads to death
carry our cowardice
control the system

crack the code
spent my days
embedded upon history
bound to flesh
knew their fate
thought this power
savoring the hunt
escaping the day
carry my soul
hurting these ghosts
feel your lies
broken rib quarter
stay the night
throw my head
comfort my pain
gone time changes
keep a body
decide my fate
is slight confusion
growing smaller ooooo
skip my brakes
remember those days
know my mind
running back pictures
know the feeling
hate the fact
hold up roll
rep the squad
slamming the doors
cross that line
dreaming my addiction
is no need
find my way
need your answer
shut the window
tell me baby
take this time
is a world
tell about redemption
kills the time
name a couple
living in purgatory
open your mind
stoke that fire
contain this feeling
get that feeling
get a way
watch the rain
is no room
lie next tou
hear the rumour
saw the river
suffocate the tongue
tell your friends

blow his brains
feathered hat motives
lays in front
wear pink feathers
tainted in sin
is a ship
stop my heart
climbed a hill
stop the world
take a picture
caught a bird
closed your eyes
do every time
burden your wings
left your mind
stay another day
burst with pride
separate the songs
poisoned the lilies
care no stay
liked the windows
open your eyes
climb 1000 mountains
say your name
hold your breath
got a hill
face her eyes
touched the countryside
keepers losers weepers
drive the night
got ten dollars
sit down look
mention my name
weathered the storm
tell me girl
seen the hills
curse the sunrise
have no home
wear your scars
adding this shit
tshirt double penetration
want my bands
know what yesterdays
turned my back
forsaken in sleep
catching a tiger
runnin my life
wait a minute
loosen the knot
stay in line
go the way
saw a girl
lost the key
got chasing shadows
made on hellos
turn the page
gimme that dust
thinking of escape
talking that mess
change no matter
faded old dress
know my love
had one chance
get your affection
written in vain
haunting my bedroom
broken my uncles
grab the guns
letting this story
born carried promise
grab my arm
got a button
came the morning
taped up tail
stealing and breaking
take my love
glue the hearts
break your heart
kill the pain
comes the sun
set my place

come to life
reducing the stigma
watch the hours

said three nights
let the light
find the words
slowing your breath
make any sound

wrote a letter
cause my tears
turn back time
played a game

know every time
wanna make love
longing for love

mean the things
make a promise
haunt me night
fell in love
walking after midnight
gives me love
read the lines
fall to pieces
having sweet dreams
need his love
filled with dreams
start their play
hate the fact
dream my dreams
is a room
go one line
takin any chances
call each others
let the world
playing a part
loves the key
take my heart
let a woman
raining hard tonight
gone the feeling
lay my dreams
hit a man
spend my lifetime
brushed your arm
look the letters
is no one
falling in love
find a brand
let the bottle
dancing all night
is a whipporwhill
wake up feelin
go darlin fields
makes no mistakes
know the reason
writing this song
leave a bottle
make no footprints
ruined her reputation
sell my soul
build our walls
replace the hole
have the heart
is a hole
bring you shame
fought the illness
learned about love
called them prince
renew whatever hope
drink our beer
took the rent
become rock stars
take a look
know the look
knew the memory
go my love
forget the taste
make every word
made your promises
lasted 24 hours
sleep at night
bashed up ways
caught every tide
feel this way
come on come
think the swelling
hit delete throw
make a mess
take a chance
drowning under covers
love a man
choose my lips
found that man
ask for love
ask the angels
comes the beast
dance the sorrow
hope your mother
playing that part
touching my skin
leave my rage
goes in waves
need your love
stop the flood
lose my mind
fell in love
had a drink
give your heart
need your love
bout the rain
mean a thing
loving every minute
share your situation
rock the crowd
put the question
is a lot
aim a lot
fell in love
control your girl
take a chill
release the juice
built to swing
get one shot
have a listen
do yknowimsayin mmm
draped in chanel

read the signs
rooted beyond repair
counting on destiny
captured your life
wearing the face
believe for years
shed some light
captured your life
take my time
open my eyes
take my hand
see the change
live a lie
breathe my innocence
took that hit
lost the will

keep singing love
want no lovers
glow your outfits
put a bullet

moving our feet
came of age
holding onto dreams
take my breath
get the feeling
spinning the alcohol
wanna talk knowledge

broke sweet believer
takes its time
leaving my love
blown your mind
changed my ways
have my boots
got crooked tales
said bad luck
knew the deal
take my hand
going through changes
saw my reflection
was another man
told you child
deck the halls
had my sister
got smokers rednecks
born silent night
following the star
born while shepherds
knew no bounds
come with patience
lowing the baby
had the window
got my thinking
watched the lighthouse
missing the rain
riding 10 speed
steal my home
tow the line
keep bad company
watching the lights
burned my fingers
buy pink stuff
get an application
spend my cash
brushed my hair
flip these bitches
got money money
looking like milk
make a woman

oer my head
look out baby

feeling the pain
see my side
got something daddy
made the ladies
meant no one
storm the gates
pity the stranger
see what chivalry
feel the night
is a tear
run no game
slamming cadillac doors
hearing crazy roomers
show these levas
buy real love
got beautiful eyes
record a song
have no money
decorated in lights
playing video games
make our way
streets the wires
aligned my stars
put some water
get your arms
save my pleasure
take my chance
know what seers

want a candle
remember that freakshow
turn your back
like your ways

vanished into space
hit the panic

come in daytime
taking your side
got a piece
hit the ground
outta my head
talking to people
wear my heart

lights my way
bound my heart
tell the girls

given my life
tell this tale
seen your picture
linger on responsibility
see the end
jaded their colours
plays the fool
is no explanation
hear the sirens
read every sign
take the fire
made of stone
weeping the roses
kiss his kiss
lost in days
look what thoughts
paved in gold
wash my skin
forget the way
going well friends
wasted your time
want no problems
alright stupid kid
kill your friends
find a reason
learning that love
reached the bottom
kiss the scars
walk on baby
believing your lies
shine the color
trap black lolita
eat hot sweat
grow higher love
fucked your girlfriend
prostitute my heart
lost in memories
hear the shadow
turn your back
play the title
give our hearts
made a vow
denied a god
whisper your name
wash your hands
wait till kingdom
is no love
kill kill kill
loving six feet
go to hell
love your plastic
raise your voice
lifes a bitch
stay strong rage
banned some fortitude
promise one day
got a ticket
lights your dark
thinking in circles
tell me baby
burn the dog
grab your steel
is no tomorrow
tell lies lies
took my baby
playing russian roulette
smell like safety
play for pennies
take your hands
find a reason
bathe her children
took my books
keeping my head
close my eyes
give my heart
touch my skin
keeps throwing stones
feel my pain
call father mother
holding on tryna
touch whoa whoa
played with love
denying these allegations
locked out love
belong where love
seem like hours
wait for love
change your mind
tell me things
know these feelings
come a time
keep from fallin
felt this way
cherish wonderfull moments
close my eyes
have the chance
smoke or fuck
went out tonight
lock my hands
need some kind
cast my fear
looking for answers
turned their backs
bleeding the pain
feel the void
go to school
walk on water
change a man
find my way
getting older time
missing the moments
got the hammer
got my girls
forget the memories
tell the truth
keep my head
breaking my heart
take the weight
go to bed
rain and rain
lose my way
build my dreams
worry bout tomorrow
feels like lightning
have no regrets
afford the lights
fuck the world
filled with hate
born that way
tore my family
ignore the stench
deleted next message
brings a smile
see a way
started this band
walking through shadows
carry me home
make the turn
turned your back
take your time
lose my mind
say your lines
throw your hands
await every time
kill this catastrophe
take the soap
have their questions
keep those chopsticks
missed the sun
complete your merge
shift my shape
have a curfew
went away holiday
turns their work
know to places
holding a styrofoam
stopped your smoking
reopened my eyes
strike a match
meant the world
has its place
come over thought
wait for someday
take the night
loving now baby
packed my bags
have a staredown
outta my house
watch your tone
get your friends
stay in line
kick your ass
build these devices
slept in weeks
had no reaason
like the taste
keep the diamonds
coming my life
had your heart
like the danger
hit the floor
turn my back
take my hand
gimmicks smart idiots
smelled like cigarettes
wondering the lovers
got the eye
became weakness rain
swear its movin
poured the ace
buy her bcs
slow down safety
saw a ghost
let your ponytail
tell ya goodbye
known the meaning
riley a house
made the mistake
is a bus
fire a gun
said your mother
paved with stone
hope our paths
had 4 channels
playing those games
hold your hand
rung drinking whiskey
offer me shelter
married two years
change your mind
is a band
leave this place
put my heart
hide your phone
got a frig
unlike every picture
swish all net
goes ping ping
brush your teeth
change your panties
brushed my teeth
buy my clothes
run this town
listen up star
got the keys
see the stars
attacks my soul
go to war
come on come
release me day
leave the past
surrounded by light
told the truth
take me home
meet the people
crosses the porch
fall in love
make her way
close your eyes
change the sadness
hear your voice
see the things
review my kisses
taking a look
need a friend
spend a life
enter the space
worry cause tonight
took a breath
hit the wall
read my mind
raise our voices
expect my disappointment
build a bridge
take my dress
eat empty dimes
want sonyas eyes
pronounce these words
has bed head
follow the road
stop this madness
bury all value
made up rock
make no red
eat like bulldogs
hands our movement
waling all day
killing the fire
walking over miles
take metal chains
lay a hand
shown my face
heard a thing
start a war
found a way
find my way
remember my name
getting any sleep
blink an eye
happened yet somethings
know your name
smiling the wind
say that tonight
fire away fire
put your hand
is no way
collide the ghost
open you heart
living this way
breath out breath
take your time
give me time
had a ring
find a light
have any friends
left the door
stands for freedom
is a heaven
built a fire
take my baby
believes in love
is any justice
ignite oh baby
face the world
saved a wretch
sings my soul
change your mind
touch you baby
stands one nation
living here today
hear that roar
seen the glory
chanting this land
walked a step
brushed my arm
break the rules
live like whitney
wit your man

like her style

throw our dreams
spend the night

kiss my lips
call it midnight
concluding some terms
go home daylight

hide my mind
looking so carefree
enter my mind
make a connection

rode in circles

play the piano

stack that paper
sleeping with sirens
round the barn
got white knuckles
get that ouh
leaves throwing rice
get the steppin
let cha motherfuckers
taught the world
take a hit
catch me gettin
carried your cedar
bring the part
tried the kiss

dropped my hand
love this woman

kept these boys
throw your money
go to bed
bout my yesterday
facing the challenge
take some time
eat cold suppers
have veggie burger
got a bag
beat my chest
rocking three goodyears
like those rules
feel the pressure
get 50 grand
catch my ride
cheating the gallows
dreams of 5k
packed our car
packed our bags
move real smooth
smoke the cookie
covered in sheets
wrote this rhyme
think the dancer
do the job
s my man
tell the truth
want a tale
pulling those strings
watcin my back
know which way
hear the sound
like the way
see the future
put a couple
hook a steak
missed your chance
have a part
kissed her baby
fucking burning phillies
bring you customers
spit the phlegm
avoid the shooting
blew my brains
keep an eye
is no one
fall in love
observe the world
rainbow colored lollipops
conducted by danny
soften the fall
get some drinks
play the beat
hits this tree
watch your mouth
hit the restart
